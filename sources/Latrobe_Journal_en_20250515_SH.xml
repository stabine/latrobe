                <salute>M<hi rend="smallcaps">y dear Children</hi>,</salute>
                <p rend="i"><lb/>IT was at your particular request, that I wrote the following
                    <lb/>circumstantial account of my visit to <placeName role="mentioned">S<hi rend="smallcaps">outh</hi> A<hi
                        rend="smallcaps">frica</hi></placeName>. Knowing, how <lb/>deeply interested you felt in
                    every thing relating to your Father, and that <lb/>the summary account of my
                    proceedings, contained in letters, would not satisfy <lb/>you, I was encouraged,
                    under all circumstances, to persevere.</p>
                <p rend="i"><lb/>I did not then expect to be called upon to publish this Journal,
                    which, <lb/>though now given to the Public, I yet consider as dedicated to <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">you</hi>. If its <lb/>publication requires any apology, I
                    am sure, that <hi rend="smallcaps">you</hi> will admit any that I <lb/>can make,
                    either for its style, its details, want of arrangement, occasional
                    <lb/>repetitions, or the freedom with which I have stated to you my sentiments
                    <lb/>and opinions on various subjects.</p>
                <p rend="i"><lb/>My official report was immediately sent to those to whom it
                    belonged; <lb/>but as you all delight in the success of the service in which I
                    was engaged, <lb/>I have introduced a pretty full account both of the external
                    construction, and <lb/>internal state, of a Mission of the United Brethren among
                    the Heathen.</p>
                <p rend="i"><lb/>Receive it, therefore, as a mark of my paternal affection, and as a
                        tes<lb break="no"/>timony of my gratitude to G<hi rend="smallcaps">od</hi>,
                    for having blessed me with children, whose <lb/>filial duty, love and
                    confidence, I have hitherto uninterruptedly enjoyed, and <lb/>of whom I may
                    cherish that firm trust, that they are not only <hi rend="smallcaps">my</hi>

                    <lb break="no"/> tentots at the Cape furnished the most convincing proofs, being
                    <lb/>generally acknowledged, Government had expressed a wish, that <lb/>a third
                    Settlement, under the superintendence of the Brethren, <lb/>might be made in the
                    interior; and condescended to give the ne<lb break="no"/>cessary directions and
                    powers for fixing upon a spot of ground, <lb/>as yet unoccupied, and suitable
                    for that purpose. On that ac<lb break="no"/>count, it was desirable, that a
                    journey should be made through <lb/>the Colony, in search of a convenient
                    situation, if existing cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances favoured the

                    in re<lb break="no"/>liance on the help of G<hi rend="smallcaps">od</hi>, to
                    whose service I count it the greatest <lb/>favour, honour, and pleasure, to be

                    often amounting to an apprehension of dan<lb break="no"/>ger, where in fact

                    former, <lb/>was in sight. This island is the most picturesque of any we had
                        hi<lb break="no"/>therto seen. Coming from the north, its first appearance
                    was that <lb/>of two steep hills inclosing a lower range; but as we sailed along
                    its <lb/>eastern coast, several ranges of mountains, of beautiful shapes and
                    <lb/>different heights, one after the other, opened to view. Some were
                    <lb/>cones, with craters on their rocky summits. The country below <lb/>them,
                    though here and there showing patches of a green colour, had, <lb/>in general, a
                    very barren appearance. The haziness of the weather <lb/>would not permit us
                    distinctly to discover any smaller objects. The <lb/>waves also sometimes
                    swelled to such a height, as to hide the island <lb/>for a moment from our view;
                    but as we passed swiftly along, we were <lb/>much amused by the continual
                    shifting of the scene, exhibiting <lb/>the mountains in ever-varying positions.
                    We were however dis<lb break="no"/>appointed in our hopes of seeing <placeName

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1815-11-06">6th</date>. This morning we had a very pleasing
                    exhibition of the won<lb break="no"/>derful agility and swiftness of a host of
                    bottle-nosed porpoises, <lb/>coming from the north. For nearly half an hour they
                    played and <lb/>frisked about the ship’s bows, leaping out of the water,
                    pursuing <lb/>each other in all directions, tumbling tail over head, and
                        perform<lb break="no"/>ing all kinds of tricks. They seemed perfectly happy,
                    and bade <lb/>defiance to all attempts to pierce them. They were, by guess, from
                    <lb/>three to four feet long. It <sic>lightned</sic> again in the evening, and

                    could be taken in. Some <lb/>mischief was done to the rigging, and we could
                    hardly stand on deck. <lb/>For about an hour, we ran furiously through the
                    water, when ano<lb break="no"/>ther cloud, much more black and threatening than
                    the former, ap<lb break="no"/>peared in the south. Its approach was announced by
                    several claps <lb/>of thunder of increasing loudness, and we prepared for a
                    heavier <lb/>squall, when, after a quarter of an hour’s violent rain, it
                    suddenly fell <lb/>calm. Then, however, our troubles began, for the sea having
                    become <lb/>extremely agitated by the fury of the former gale, the swell was
                        tre<lb break="no"/>mendous; and as there was no wind to carry us forward,
                    the ship, be<lb break="no"/>ing at its mercy, plunged very hard. A wave struck
                    her a-stern, broke <lb/>two of the cabin windows, overstreamed all the books,
                    papers, and <lb/>whatever lay on the lockers, and filled the floor some inches
                    high <lb/>with water. Fortunately not much injury was done, but we were
                    <lb/>obliged to put in dead-lights, and glad to retreat on deck out of so
                    <lb/>hot and dark a dungeon. Our patience was now again put to trial <lb/>by the
                    return of calms and light baffling winds, by the sailors called <lb/>cat’s-paws.
                    In the evening, a hawk, after flying long about the ship, <lb/>perched on the
                    fore-yard near the fore-top, and was taken. She was <lb/>a beautiful bird. I
                    protested against her destruction, as being con<lb break="no"/>trary to all
                    rules of hospitality, but could not save her.</p>

                    little either <lb/>of wind or rain. More short squalls assailed us during the
                    day. A <lb/>brig having appeared in sight to the north-east, and proving to be

                    we sent a packet of letters on <lb/>board, which her captain promised to deliver

                <p><lb/>In the evening, clouds came on with thunder and lightning, and <lb/>while we
                    were singing our evening-hymn, several strong flashes illu<lb break="no"/>mined

                    <lb/>morning by news, that a large ship was approaching. A general <lb/>scramble

                    eastward twenty days ago, while we <lb/>were in smooth water. Her captain was
                    glad to rectify his reck<lb break="no"/>oning by the calculations made by our

                    our voyage. <lb/>But we have no cause for complaint. Rather ought we to be very
                    <lb/>thankful to Him, whom wind and waves obey, that our voyage has <lb/>been
                    attended with no disaster whatever; and though sometimes <lb/>annoyed by calms,
                    we have seldom met with contrary winds, <lb/>or any thing like a storm. Ever
                    since we entered the south-east <lb/>trades, the sails have nearly stood in the
                    same position; and by <lb/>many favourable shifts of wind, we have been able to

                    To-day, a species of that curious animal, called <lb/>by some the Portuguese man

                    <lb/>shrunk together, and almost vanished, nothing but a small pulpy

                    <lb/>several ostriches and other birds, and in a separate building, a lion,

                    <lb/>time grew so strong, that we could hardly stem its force. The <lb/>change
                    from the most clear, calm, and warm weather, to storm <lb/>and fog, was almost

                    driven along by the gale, shivering with <lb/>cold, and glad to make the best of
                    our way towards home. The <lb/>storm proved also a great annoyance to several

                        time spent with this hospitable family, we returned, <lb/>calling again at

                            house</rs> by the way. It is a good Dutch <lb/>building,
                        delightfully situated among shady groves of various <lb/>trees. The garden
                        abounds with a vast variety of large flowering <lb/>shrubs and plants. The
                        portico or gallery, running along the <lb/>whole front of the building, has
                        an espalier roof entirely covered <lb/>with vines, the grapes hanging down
                        in great profusion and beau<lb break="no"/>ty. An aviary contains some
                        curious birds, both from <placeName role="mentioned">Africa</placeName>
                        <lb/>and the <placeName role="mentioned">East Indies</placeName>.
                            <persName>Mr. Zorn</persName> was not at home; but we were
                        <lb/>hospitably received by <persName>Mr. Cloete</persName>, his son-in-law.
                        Walking down <lb/>the hill, the town presents itself very pleasantly, its
                        streets <lb/>crossing each other at right angles, with <placeName

                        back-ground; but the want of towers and other <lb/>prominent features
                        detracts from its beauty. On the road, we <lb/>noticed some large spiders,
                        red locusts, and grasshoppers, peculiar <lb/>to <placeName role="mentioned"
                            >the Cape</placeName>. My time at home was taken up with visiting both

                    generous friends. Our caravan <lb/>consisted of four waggons. The first, drawn
                    by twelve, and the <lb/>second, by fourteen bullocks, were occupied by our own

                    Curtains, of sailcloth or leather, hang before and be<lb break="no"/>hind, to

                    seem to draw with ease. The Hottentot driver <lb/>has a whip, the stick of which
                    is a strong bamboo, twelve and <lb/>more feet long, and the lash, a plaited
                    thong of equal or greater <lb/>length. With this, to European grasp, unwieldy

                    with <lb/>the greatest surety. But the chief engine of his government is his

                    <lb/>about their horns, and they seem to follow him willingly. We <lb/>were

                    <lb/>we excused ourselves, wishing yet to proceed farther, before we took
                    <lb/>up our night’s lodging in the wilderness. In about an hour’s time, <lb/>we
                    unyoked the bullocks, and left them to seek their supper <lb/>among the bushes.
                    This is always done, if possible, at a place <lb/>where there is a stream or
                    pool of fresh water. The Hottentots <lb/>having lighted a fire, a mat was spread
                    on the ground to leeward of <lb/>a large bush of the poison-apple, which
                    screened us from a sharp <lb/>south-east wind, black clouds on the horizon
                    threatening us with a <lb/>stormy, and perhaps rainy night. Coffee was boiled;
                    of which, with <lb/>some eggs, cold meat, cakes, and milk, we made an excellent
                    supper, <lb/>sitting round the fire. After our repast, we retired into the
                        wag<lb break="no"/>gon to rest. The fire going out, and no preparation for
                    our depar<lb break="no"/>ture being made, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName>,
                    on inquiry, found, that eleven oxen <lb/>were missing, for which the Hottentots
                    had been searching in vain. <lb/>To point out to the latter the place of our
                    encampment, as well as to <lb/>guard against the cold in this dark night, some
                    of us rekindled the <lb/>fire, keeping up a constant blaze, by feeding it with
                    rhinoceros <lb/>bushes, a resinous plant with large roots, but easily pulled up.
                    After <lb/>some hours, all hopes of finding the lost cattle having vanished, a
                    <lb/>different arrangement was made, and we proceeded with two wag<lb break="no"

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1815-12-31">31st.</date> After the forenoon’s service, a
                    Hottentot accosted me, <lb/>desiring to speak with me alone. As I could not

                    present. The poor man came <lb/>to make confession of his having been seduced by

                        >Capetown</placeName>, to drink more than he ought to have done; <lb/>that

                    the first part of the night, and suffered the cattle to go <lb/>astray; and that
                    he now came to ask forgiveness. Though his <lb/>situation at that time was not
                    observed by us, yet it had given <lb/>offence to the Hottentots; and we
                    represented to him, that he <lb/>had not only hurt his own soul, but brought
                    disgrace upon the <lb/>cause of the gospel: that therefore it was necessary, for

                    <lb/>wrought in the heart of a heathen, who in his former state, thought

                    speaking on various subjects, within the reach of <lb/>their apprehension. Some
                    accompany their speech with gesticula<lb break="no"/>tions, which are natural
                    and very unlike the grimaces of certain <lb/>Europeans. The manner of the
                    missionaries in conversing with, <lb/>and instructing them, struck me as
                    peculiarly calculated to call forth <lb/>their confidence, as well as to impress

                        >Hottentot’s Holland</placeName>. After <lb/>fording the <placeName

                            ><persName>Mr. Alexander</persName>’s own farm</rs>. I <lb/>was
                    surprised to find here a Hottentot waiting for me. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother Bo<lb

                        Kloof</placeName>, spent the heat of the day at a miserable <lb/>inn,
                    intending, on my arrival, to pass over the kloof in the cool of the
                    <lb/>evening. I joined them immediately after dinner. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Mars<lb
                            break="no"/>veld</persName> and <rs type="person">his wife</rs> had
                    already set out on foot, and we followed with <lb/>three waggons. The
                    pedestrians met a herd of ten or twelve baboons <lb/>on the road. The cowardly
                    creatures betook themselves speedily to <lb/>flight, and with astonishing
                    dexterity and swiftness, scaled the steep, <lb/>and to man, inaccessible cliffs,
                    where they made a stand, till the <lb/>cracks of the Hottentots’ whips so
                    frightened them, that they in an <lb/>instant disappeared, but kept up a hideous
                    yell for some time.</p>
                <p><lb/>This kloof is celebrated in the journals of our missionaries for its
                    <lb/>difficult and steep ascent and the badness of the road. My imagi<lb

                        pas<lb break="no"/>sage across these mountains, and I now found the accounts
                    given <lb/>by no means exaggerated. Twenty-four oxen having been sent <lb/>from
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> to meet us, our
                    complement had increased to fifty <lb/>four, and it was with difficulty, that
                    even this number drew the <lb/>loaded waggons up the rugged road. The lower part
                    of the hill <lb/>is richly covered with grass, flowering shrubs, and bushes, but
                    the up<lb break="no"/>per region is a wild, solitary, and vast assemblage of
                    rocks, thrown <lb/>together without any appearance of regular strata.</p>
                <p><lb/>After passing the summit, the descent is more gradual, and a fine <lb/>full
                    moon lighted us on our way to the first station, where we un<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>Among these a wolf descended from the mountain, and was choos<lb break="no"

                    frightened away by the cracks of the long whip. The wolf <lb/>of <placeName

                    again halted on the <placeName role="visited">Botte Revier</placeName>, where we
                    breakfasted. <lb/>Most of the company then retired into the waggons to sleep;
                    but, <lb/>always hoping to meet with some remarkable production of nature
                    <lb/>in this strange land, I walked along the banks of the river towards
                    <lb/>the hill. The country is dreary in the extreme. A solitary cottage
                    <lb/>attracted my attention, and making towards it, I overtook <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123464045">Sister
                        <lb/>Clemens</persName> examining the pebbles of various colours which cover
                    <lb/>part of the bank. They were fragments of sand-stone coloured <lb/>by iron.
                    We entered the cottage together, and found a friendly <lb/>woman in it, with two
                    slaves, and some black children. She in<lb break="no"/>formed us, that her
                    relations lived on the other side, in two farm<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"
                    />houses. A slave-girl, who had been at <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Gnadenthal</placeName>, offering to <lb/>show us the way, conducted us
                    across the river, over a rocky part <lb/>of its bed, and through some vineyards
                    and gardens, to the first <lb/>house. Here an old Dutch farmer, with a grey
                    beard of a week’s <lb/>growth, came out to meet us, but seemed not disposed to
                    give us <lb/>a friendly reception. At length, hearing that we came from
                        <placeName role="mentioned">the <lb/>Cape</placeName>, his curiosity to
                    know, for what purpose a Dutch fleet had <lb/>arrived in <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Table-Bay</placeName>, made him ask us to sit down. Leaving
                    <lb/>his inhospitable dwelling, we walked on to the next farm, where <lb/>our
                    reception was very different. The good-natured housewife <lb/>even asked us to
                    pluck the fruit of some mulberry-trees, standing <lb/>before her door. On our
                    return, we found the black slave-girl <lb/>waiting for us at the fording-place.
                    She presented <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123464045">Sister Cle<lb break="no"/>mens</persName> with a nosegay

                    companion ready to receive them, and hope that <lb/>they derived benefit from
                    their meeting. After some usual inqui<lb break="no"/>ries, he spoke most
                    affectionately with the woman, her slaves and <lb/>children, of the necessity of
                    conversion, and that blessedness <lb/>which is to be found in communion with the
                    Lord Jesus. His ad<lb break="no"/>dress was heard with much attention, and drew
                    tears from their <lb/>eyes. It proved to us all a most edifying
                    morning-service.</p>
                <p><lb/>The Hottentots and their cattle not being yet ready to proceed,
                    <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123420358">Brother Lemmerz</persName> accompanied me on a second walk
                    down the river, <lb/>till the steepness of its banks arrested our progress. The
                    country has <lb/>a most comfortless appearance. To the south, lies a chain of
                    hills, <lb/>among which <placeName role="visited_nearby">the Tower of
                        Babel</placeName> is the highest. They are all bar<lb break="no"/>ren, and
                    chiefly rock. At length our phlegmatic drivers thought <lb/>proper to proceed,
                    but after three hours, on account of the heat, <lb/>they halted again near a
                    little valley, at the bottom of which flows <lb/>a rivulet in the rainy season;
                    but we now found only a few stagnant <lb/>pools. Here I continued my researches,
                    and saw the first land<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>tortoise, of the species
                    called by the Dutch, Patlooper, from their <lb/>generally keeping on the
                    path-way or carriage-road. It was about <lb/>four inches square, of a greenish
                    colour, the compartments of its <lb/>shell fringed with brown and yellow. Small
                    broken fragments of <lb/>white opaque quartz are here everywhere mixed with the
                    iron and <lb/>sand-stone, gravel, and pebbles. In the evening, we halted again,
                    <lb/>and proceeding slowly, arrived towards morning at <rs type="place" role="visited"

                    yoked to the waggon, the Hottentots <lb/>could hardly keep them from going off
                    in a wild gallop. They <lb/>almost ran over the boys, who led the foremost. As

                <p><lb/>I was very comfortably lodged, and cannot but here acknowledge, <lb/>with

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-01-16">16th.</date> When I awoke in the morning, I
                    could hardly believe, that <lb/>I was actually at <placeName role="visited"
                        >Gnadenthal</placeName>; a place, which for so many years has <lb/>been the
                    subject of my thoughts and my prayers; of which I have <lb/>so long delighted to
                    speak and write, and which I have so often <lb/>visited in spirit. It was my
                    most fervent wish and prayer, that the <lb/>Lord would make this visit
                    profitable to my own soul; and, if I <lb/>might be thus highly favoured,
                    beneficial to the cause I came to <sic>to</sic> serve.</p>
                <p><lb/>Immediately after breakfast, I went into <rs type="place" role="visited">the
                        church</rs>. From with<lb break="no"/>out, its appearance by no means
                    exhibits the classical taste of the <lb/>architect: but it is imposing by its
                    size, the thickness of its walls, <lb/>which are of unburnt brick, plaistered
                    and yellow-washed, its arched <lb/>windows, its high roof, and its gable-ends,
                    serrated or finished in <lb/>short steps, with a vane on the point of each. In
                    short, it looks like <lb/>nothing else, and its general character immediately
                    pronounces it <lb/>to be a place of worship. The height of its roof makes it a
                    very <lb/>conspicuous object in approaching the valley from every side, and
                    <lb/>nothing is wanting but a slender turret in the centre of the roof of
                    <lb/>about twenty or thirty feet in height, to give it all the appearance
                    <lb/>of an ancient ecclesiastical building. The doors are, in my opinion,
                    <lb/>on the wrong side. It should turn its main front to the village,
                    <lb/>whereas, now, it faces <rs type="place" role="visited_nearby">the

                    <lb/>each door and the gable-end. The front towards the village has <lb/>arched
                    windows. The arches over the doors are glazed. On <lb/>entering the building, I
                    was agreeably struck with its neatness <lb/>and cleanliness. Two columns, about
                    a yard in diameter, support <lb/>the immense roof, and at first sight, surprise
                    every beholder. That <lb/>thickness was thought necessary, as they are
                    constructed of unburnt <lb/>brick. They resemble the plainest Saxon columns in

                    contributing much to the cheerful look of <lb/>this temple. The body of the
                    church, with the gallery, which oc<lb break="no"/>cupies three of its sides,
                    will hold upwards of a thousand persons. <lb/>The front of the gallery is
                    supported by iron bars, pendant from the <lb/>beams in the ceiling. The latter
                    is not plaistered, but is a neat <lb/>flooring of yellow-wood upon a joist. The
                    plain outside of the <lb/>gallery, is relieved by a very simple, but ingenious
                    contrivance. <lb/>Upright boards, shaped like pilasters, are nailed upon the
                    horizontal <lb/>planks, which give the whole a finished appearance. The minis<lb
                        break="no"/>ter’s table is, I think, inconveniently placed between the two
                        en<lb break="no"/>trances. On Sundays, it is converted into a species of
                    pulpit, by <lb/>placing a high desk upon it. The whole is covered with green
                    <lb/>cloth, and elevated on a step above the floor. This step runs the
                    <lb/>whole length from door to door, under the seats of the missionaries.
                    <lb/>The space under the gallery at the east-end, is boarded off, as a
                    <lb/>small vestry, used only as a waiting room for the officiating minis<lb
                        break="no"/>ter, and to dress, previous to the holy sacrament. The church is
                    <lb/>lighted by three lamps, hanging, one in the centre, and one on <lb/>each
                    side, in a line with the columns. The congregation sit on <lb/>benches, the men
                    on the east, the women on the west-side of the <lb/>building; both below, and in
                    the gallery, a space of about two <lb/>yards down the middle, forms a passage
                    between them; at the bot<lb break="no"/>tom of which stands another large table,
                    used at the communion, <lb/>and in the meetings for instruction and
                    catechisation, when those <lb/>present turn with their faces towards it.</p>

                        >Gnadenthal</placeName>, I determined to lose no <lb/>opportunity of
                    obtaining a complete knowledge, both of its inward <lb/>and outward state, and
                    of contributing, to the best of my power, <lb/>by advice and assistance, towards
                    its prosperity. I therefore be<lb break="no"/>gan immediately to consult the
                    missionaries in what manner my <lb/>time might be most profitably spent in this
                    service. Besides many <lb/>conferences with reference to the internal and
                    spiritual concerns of <lb/>the Mission, we were led to consider the necessity of
                    making va<lb break="no"/>rious improvements, as far as our slender means would
                    permit. The <lb/>missionaries, who had accompanied me hither, found no dwellings
                    <lb/>provided for them, and were rather uncomfortably lodged in the
                    <lb/><rs type="place" role="mentioned">garden-house</rs>, the gardening tools having been previously removed, <lb/>and
                    at <rs type="place" role="mentioned">the inn, a house kept by a Hottentot</rs>, and chiefly used by <lb/>farmers
                    visiting the settlement, to refresh themselves and their horses, <lb/>for a few

                    />sionaries, having each only one room for himself and family, could <lb/>not
                    possibly take them in. An additional building, therefore, <lb/>seemed
                    indispensably necessary; and we resolved to build a house, <lb/>in a line with
                    <rs type="place" role="mentioned">the school</rs> and <rs type="place" role="mentioned">smithy</rs>, which should contain three <lb/>rooms and a joiner’s

                <p><lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456495">Brother Peter Leitner</persName> was intrusted with the

                    <lb/>from affection and gratitude to the missionaries, they will engage <lb/>to
                    work: if, however, they have no relish for it themselves, they <lb/>are apt to
                    go about it rather sluggishly. But if the work please <lb/>them, which was here
                    the case, no European workmen exceed them <lb/>in spirit and diligent attention;
                    only the execution must not last <lb/>too long, lest, like children, they begin
                    to get tired of it. They are <lb/>flattered and pleased when visited by their

                    and now and then lend <lb/>assistance, if only by removing a stone, or helping
                    to lift a beam.</p>
                <p><lb/>Before dinner, <rs type="person_group">two English officers of dragoons</rs> arrived on a visit.
                    <lb/>They appeared highly pleased with the whole settlement; particu<lb

                    <lb/>It gave me pleasure to accompany them in their walk, and to satisfy

                <p><lb/>In the evening-meeting, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Brother Marsveld</persName> delivered a

                    to find <lb/>him still able to speak with so much energy and strength of
                        recol<lb break="no"/>lection in spiritual things.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-01-17">17th.</date> We rose at the first sound of the

                    any other <lb/>morning-hymn, and then take a dish of coffee; but what they call
                    <lb/>breakfast is not ready till <date when-iso="1816-01-17T08:00">eight o’clock</date>, and more like a luncheon.
                    <lb/>Very little time is spent at their meals. Between twelve and one <lb/>they
                    dine; drink tea or coffee at two; sup between six and seven, <lb/>and go to the
                    church at eight, when the whole congregation meet <lb/>for evening-worship.
                    Every day, however, has its regular meetings <lb/>for one or other division of
                    the congregation, for instruction in the <lb/>Christian doctrines. The schools
                    are held in the forenoon for the <lb/>boys, and in the afternoon for the
                    girls.</p>
                <p><lb/>After breakfast, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother Bonatz</persName> walked with me into

                    </fw>
                    <lb/>when we entered about a dozen houses. The village consists at <lb/>present
                    of two hundred and fifty-six cottages and huts, containing <lb/>twelve hundred
                    and seventy-six inhabitants. The dwellings are <lb/>differently constructed.
                    Some of the new people who are permit<lb break="no"/>ted to reside here on
                    trial, or the poorest of the inhabitants, put up <lb/>a hut, made with a few
                    upright poles, between which there is a watt<lb break="no"/>ling of reeds or
                    rushes, or a species of slender cane. Again, others <lb/>have walls of unburnt
                    brick, or wattling covered with a clay plais<lb break="no"/>tering, with square
                    doors and windows, and a well-thatched roof. <lb/>None of them are fond of too
                    much light; and generally one win<lb break="no"/>dow, or at most two, serves for
                    the whole house, before which not <lb/>unfrequently hangs a curtain of
                    sheep-skin to prevent any intrusion <lb/>of the sun’s rays.</p>
                <p><lb/>Each house has a garden belonging to it, and the state of the <lb/>garden
                    generally betrays the disposition of the inhabitant. Some <lb/>are kept neat,
                    and produce good crops; others, though not many, <lb/>are full of weeds. The
                    missionary upon whom this branch of ser<lb break="no"/>vice devolves, after
                    exercising due patience in admonishing and <lb/>warning the possessor, may
                    deprive him of it, and give it to another. <lb/>Most of the gardens, however,
                    look well; and being separated from <lb/>each other by low hedges or bushes, the
                    whole valley appears well <lb/>clothed with verdure.</p>
                <p><lb/>In some of the dwellings, the children of the poor, particularly <lb/>the
                    little boys, go naked; and some of the men wear only karosses <lb/>and aprons,
                    after the old Hottentot fashion. But those that have <lb/>better earnings, soon
                    provide themselves with jackets and trowsers, <lb/>and other articles of
                    European dress, which they always wear on <lb/>Sundays, clothing their children
                    in linen or calico shirts, trowsers, <lb/>or petticoats. The head-dress of the
                    women is a handkerchief, <lb/>neatly infolding their heads, above the ears, with
                    a loop in front, <lb/>and looks well.</p>
                <p><lb/>On each side of the valley, the cottages are placed in rows; but <lb/>the
                    rest are irregularly distributed between them. Though at first <lb/>I had joined

                    <lb break="no"/>gular plan had been followed throughout, by degrees I became
                    <lb/>pleased with the romantic irregularity of the interior part of the
                    <lb/>settlement, when, as I walked among the hedges on a serpentine
                    <lb/>foot-path, I unexpectedly met with a snug cottage under cover of
                    <lb/>quince, fig, and other fruit-trees, and an assemblage of women and
                    <lb/>children sitting at work under their shade; then, after some friendly
                    <lb/>conversation, passing on, I again surprised another family with a
                    <lb/>visit. In one of the huts, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother Bonatz</persName> desired a
                    poor boy, <lb/>dressed only in a kaross and apron, to read some verses in the
                    bible <lb/>to me, which he did without hesitation.</p>
                <p><lb/>At <date when-iso="1816-01-17T15:00">three o’clock in the afternoon</date>, a pretty large congregation of
                    <lb/>communicants attended the confirmation of a Hottentot woman, <lb/>previous
                    to her first participation of the Holy Communion. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122701083">Father

                        role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> before the late disturbances; and
                    when all the Caffres <lb/>were banished the colony, and obliged to retreat
                    across the <placeName role="mentioned">Great <lb/>Fish River</placeName>, those
                    belonging to the Brethren’s Mission obtained <lb/>leave from Government to
                    remain here, and have always conducted <lb/>themselves in the most peaceable and
                    orderly manner. Some of <lb/>them are distinguished by their exemplary conduct.
                    They differ in <lb/>features and in habits from the Hottentots; but here,
                    associate with <lb/>them in perfect amity.</p>
                <p><lb/>From thence we went into a kloof or valley called <placeName role="visited"

                    <lb/>evil. On this subject she delivered herself with a kind of fer<lb
                        break="no"/>vour and eloquence, which would have done credit to the most
                        ci<lb break="no"/>vilized orator. She spoke with great humility of the mercy
                    shown <lb/>to herself, of the privilege she enjoyed of living among a people of
                    <lb/>God, of her ardent desire, that her own brother and sister, and all
                    <lb/>her country-people, should experience the same; and entreated, that
                    <lb/>they might not be forgotten. She was afraid, “that perhaps the
                    <lb/>teachers might leave off praying for them.” She had, however, <lb/>found a
                    text of Scripture which revived her hopes: “I will bring the <lb/>blind by a way
                    that they knew not.” Is. xlii. 16. She would therefore <lb/>yet hope “that our
                    Saviour would send to them His word, and call <lb/>them to partake of His
                    salvation.” I answered, that I could assure <lb/>her, that her countrymen were
                    not forgotten by the Fathers and <lb/>Brethren in <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Europe</placeName>, and that I had been particularly commissioned <lb/>to
                    make inquiry about the practicability of establishing a Mission <lb/>in her
                    country; but having spoken with the <rs type="person">Governor</rs> and other
                    <lb/>persons in office, I was given to understand, that just now, it would
                    <lb/>not be safe, while the war lasted. She replied, that the boors <pb n="70"/>

                    <lb/>were in fault, but she hoped that the war would soon cease, and <lb/>then
                    that something would be done for them. She thought “that <lb/>the best way to
                    begin a Mission would be, to send one or more <lb/>Caffres to <persName>king
                            T<hi rend="superscripted">e</hi>Geika</persName>, and inform him of the

                    now the Caffres might <lb/>kill the boors for robbing them of their land, they
                    would protect <lb/>missionaries coming from <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Gnadenthal</placeName>; that a settlement might <lb/>be formed, by the
                    Caffre part of this congregation becoming the <lb/>first settlers in any part of
                    their country, suitable for the purpose, <lb/>and that, if a mission were begun,
                    and succeeded, there would be <lb/>an end of all Caffre wars with the English.”
                    The name of this <lb/>woman is <persName>Wilhelmina</persName>, a communicant,
                    and in her person, <lb/>manner, and neatness of apparel, superior to any of the
                    Hottentots. <lb/>I was much pleased and edified by her conversation.</p>
                <p><lb/>It is the common custom, in this warm climate, for every person <lb/>who can
                    afford the time, to take a nap after dinner, and I was ad<lb break="no"/>vised
                    to do the same, under an idea, that without it there is too <lb/>much waste of
                    strength. To-day, I walked <date notBefore-iso="1816-01-18T13:00">after dinner</date> into <rs type="place" role="visited">the <lb/>great garden, and sat down

                    <lb/>the time in drawing, by the help of the camera obscura, nor did I <lb/>ever
                    feel inconvenience from wakefulness. I walked this afternoon <lb/>with

                    <lb/>all the new-comers went with <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother Bonatz</persName> on a visit

                    severe a blow in his stomach by the kick of a <lb/>horse, that his life was in

                    <lb/>to see him. We found him lying on his breast, under a hedge, with <lb/>four
                    or five women sitting near him. Some men had conveyed him <lb/>thus far on a
                    bed-stead, when, not able to bear the motion, he beg<lb break="no"/>ged to be
                    put down. We encouraged him to endeavour to rise; <lb/>and, after he had taken
                    some medicine, four stout men carried him <lb/>to his dwelling, but the door
                    being too narrow to admit the bed<lb break="no"/>stead, they conveyed him into
                    the stable. He was in great ago<lb break="no"/>ny, and his case truly pitiable.
                    His wife had just been delivered. <lb/>They were extremely poor, and had four
                    young children alive; one <lb/>was lately drowned. They spoke of their
                    complicated distress, with <lb/>resignation to the will of God, and poor
                        <persName>Stephen</persName> expressed his con<lb break="no"/>viction, that
                    he should depart out of this world, praying that the <lb/>Lord would have mercy
                    on him and take him to himself. On <lb/>our return, something was sent for the
                    relief of the patient.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the evening, I walked with <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123420358">Brother Lemmerz</persName> into <rs type="place" role="visited">the
                    Kloof</rs>. <lb/>We worked our way through the bushes towards a rocky eminence,
                    <lb/>from which I hoped to gain a view of the division made in the up<lb

                    disappointed. <lb/>A number of children of both sexes were employed in getting
                        fire<lb break="no"/>wood, all with naked feet, and not half dressed, fearing
                    neither thorns, <lb/>sharp stones, nor serpents, which are not unfrequently met
                    with. <lb/>The stone throughout the kloof is sand-stone, generally of a reddish
                    <lb/>hue, intersected by veins of white quartz, here and there imperfectly
                    <lb/>chrystalized. The rocks appear as if they were put together of frag<lb

                    <lb/>of the missionaries and the Hottentots. In the evening-service, I <lb/>was
                    more than ever charmed with the voices of the congregation.</p>
                <p><lb/>Before I proceed in my narrative, it may be proper to give an <lb/>account
                    of some of the internal regulations of the missionary set<lb break="no"
                    />tlements of the <orgName>United Brethren</orgName>, which are the same in
                    every coun<lb break="no"/>try. The gospel is preached to all heathen, to whom
                    the missiona<lb break="no"/>ries can gain access, and every one invited to be
                    reconciled to God, <lb/>through the atonement made by Jesus Christ. Besides the
                    public <lb/>testimony of the gospel, the missionaries are diligently employed
                    <lb/>in visiting and conversing with the heathen in their dwellings. If <lb/>any
                    come to the missionaries for further instruction, giving in their <lb/>names,
                    they are called <hi rend="i">New People</hi>, and special attention is paid to
                    <lb/>them. If their subsequent conduct proves their sincerity, and they
                    <lb/>desire to be initiated into the Christian Church by Holy Baptism, <lb/>they
                    are considered as <hi rend="i">Candidates for Baptism</hi>, and, after previous
                        in<lb break="no"/>struction, and a convenient time of probation, <hi
                        rend="i">baptized</hi>. In admit<lb break="no"/>ting them to the Holy
                    Communion, they are first permitted to be <lb/>once present as spectators, and
                    called <hi rend="i">Candidates for the Communion</hi>; <lb/>and after some time,
                    become <hi rend="i">Communicants</hi>. Each of these divi<lb break="no"/>sions
                    have separate meetings, in which they are instructed in all <lb/>things relating
                    to a godly life and walk. Separate meetings are <lb/>also held with other
                    divisions of the congregation; with the children, <lb/>the single men, the
                    single women, the married people, the widowers, <lb/>and widows, in which the
                    admonitions and precepts given in the <lb/>Holy Scriptures for each state of
                    life are inculcated. Every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the congregation is
                    expected to come, at stated seasons, to <lb/>converse with the missionaries; the
                    men with a missionary, and the <lb/>women with his wife, by which a more perfect
                    knowledge of the <lb/>individuals is gained, and an opportunity afforded to
                    each, to request <lb/>and receive special advice. From among the most approved
                    of the <lb/>people of both sexes, <hi rend="i">Assistants</hi> are appointed in
                    large congregations, <lb/>who visit the sick, make reports to the missionaries,
                    and help to <lb/>maintain order. Others are employed as <hi rend="i"

                    chapel-servants had a meeting, as <lb/>usual in the beginning of the year, the
                    aim of which is, to encourage <lb/>them to diligence and faithfulness in their
                    service. The conversa<lb break="no"/>tion was free, unaffected, and edifying.
                    Many of them, both men <lb/>and women, joined in it with great modesty.
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName>, af<lb break="no"/>ter a short address,
                    asked some questions concerning their service, <lb/>and their views in accepting
                    of the appointment. Their answers <lb/>surprised and delighted me. They proved,
                    that these people, lately <lb/>so ignorant, had, by the instruction, not of men,
                    but of the Spirit of <lb/>God, conceived views and ideas of the service in the
                    house of God <lb/>more just, than many who think themselves far more
                    enlightened. <lb/>Their spirit seemed truly that of <persName key="wd:Q41370"
                        >David</persName>, who would rather be a <lb/>door-keeper in the house of
                    the Lord, than dwell in the tents of the <lb/>wicked. One said, that he felt so
                    unworthy of being thus employed, <lb/>that when he rose to snuff the candles, he
                    almost trembled, lest he <lb/>should do any thing to disturb the congregation or
                    the teacher. <lb/>The conversation turned also upon brotherly love, and a
                    willingness <lb/>to help each other in trouble or sickness, which is not natural
                    to <lb/>the Hottentots. This gave occasion to many practical observa<lb
                        break="no"/>tions, and my quoting the simile used in Scripture, of the
                        inti<lb break="no"/>mate connexion of the members of the body, that if one
                    suffer, <lb/>the whole is affected, with explanations given by some of the
                        mis<lb break="no"/>sionaries present, seemed to make a deep impression upon
                    them. <lb/>They with one consent expressed their thankfulness for having re<lb
                        break="no"/>ceived more teachers, and for my visit. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father
                        Marsveld</persName>’s man<lb break="no"/>ner in leading the conversation,
                    was that of a sensible parent addres<lb break="no"/>sing sensible children. To
                    me, this opportunity of noticing the <lb/>disposition of the Hottentots, when
                    converted to Christ, was singu<lb break="no"/>larly agreeable and important.
                    Shortly after, they all came into my <lb/>room, to pay me a special visit, and
                    once more to bid me welcome. <lb/>The camera obscura happening to stand in a

                    <lb/>my mind. Both he and his wife were worthy members of the congre<lb

                <p><lb/>As Sunday is generally a day, on which strangers attend divine <lb/>worship,

                    and not of <lb/>“man, that we almost forget, that we have at all been employed
                    <lb/>“in it. When we came hither, our utmost hope was, that we <lb/>“might
                    perhaps, in a course of years, see forty or fifty Hotten<lb break="no"/>“tots
                    converted and formed into a Christian congregation; and as <lb/>“we were
                    travelling towards this place, we prayed to our Saviour, <lb/>“that He might
                    bless and support us; and if He granted us <lb/>“the favour to see but one soul
                    converted in truth, we should <lb/>“think ourselves well rewarded. And now, when
                    we behold <lb/>“what He has done, we are indeed overwhelmed with gratitude
                    <lb/>“and amazement: but not unto us, not unto us, to His name a<lb break="no"
                    />“lone be all the glory and all the praise.” This was likewise the
                    <lb/>constant expression of <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122701083">Father Schwinn</persName>: he once said to

                    <lb/>“have done many things amiss, and have nothing to boast of, but
                    <lb/>“mercy. The Lord forgave us our sins, healed every breach, and <lb/>“helped
                    us to serve Him with gladness from day to day, while we <pb n="75"/>

                    visited <rs type="place" role="visited">the hot springs. <lb/>They are situated in an eminence behind the new
                    bathing-house</rs>. <lb/>The principal one proceeds from an opening, about a foot and
                    a <lb/>half wide, the depth of which is not yet ascertained. The temper<lb

                    The <lb/>soil on this part of the mountain is a black mould, as fine as pow<lb

                    <lb/>filled with a glistening substance. Most of it appears to have <lb/>passed
                    through fire; here and there showing decomposition, and <lb/>yielding a bright

                    <lb/>lowest, as well as the highest ranks of society. The wife, with the
                    <lb/>assistance of her daughter, a girl of about eighteen years of age, <lb/>had
                    most unmercifully beaten a female slave in their service, though <lb/>with
                    child, wounding her from head to foot. Complaints of this act <lb/>of barbarity
                    having been brought before the Judge, at the circuit, <lb/>lately established in
                    this colony, and the cruel perpetrators being <lb/>found guilty, they were
                    condemned to pay three hundred rix<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>dollars
                    fine, two thousand rix-dollars costs of suit, and that their <lb/>slaves should
                    all be sold, but not to one of their family. The farm <lb/>appeared in a very
                    delapidated state.</p>
                <p><lb/>Some Hottentot women belonging to <placeName role="mentioned"
                        key="wd:Q1501295">Gnadenthal</placeName>, being
                    at work <lb/>in the field, ran towards our waggon, expressed in the most
                    friendly <lb/>manner their joy at seeing their teachers, and delivered some
                    little <lb/>commissions to our driver and leader for their friends and families.
                    <lb/>I was vastly pleased with this rencontre. We halted at <rs type="place"
                        role="visited">a farm</rs>, where <lb/>the family gave us a friendly
                    reception. I had been all day troubled <lb/>with violent <sic>headach</sic>, but
                    was cured by some hot tea, which, though <lb/>proceeding from a dirty pewter
                    urn, with sops of spider’s legs, and <lb/>fragments of the wings and bodies of
                    flies, gave me almost immediate <lb/>relief: whether owing to the decoction of
                    these particles of insects, <lb/>to the heat of the water, or any other cause, I
                    waited not to exa<lb break="no"/>mine, but felt thankful for my recovery.</p>
                <p><lb/>The road now turned towards the <placeName role="visited_nearby">Gnadenthal

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-01-26">26th</date>. After breakfast, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124709145">Brother
                        Clemens</persName> accompanied me into <lb/>the garden, the burial-ground,
                    and other premises, when I men<lb/>tioned to him some ideas of improvement, by
                    which regularity and <lb/>beauty might, in my opinion, be much furthered, at a
                    small expense. <lb/>But I will candidly confess, that by the time I had been a
                    few <lb/>months in <placeName role="mentioned">Africa</placeName>, and become
                    better acquainted with the difficul<lb/>ties presenting themselves on all sides,
                    in promoting improvement, <lb/>both moral and physical, I was rather disposed to
                    stand astonished <lb/>at what had been done, in so short a time, by our Brethren
                    in this <lb/>place, and at <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName>,
                    than to expect immediate attention to <lb/>my suggestions. Those venerable men,
                        <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Marsveld</persName>
                    and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122701083">Schwinn</persName>, <lb/>heard my remarks with great patience and
                        <sic>forbearance</sic>, as they were <lb/>never made, but under a conviction
                    of my being a novice, and with <lb/>all due and unfeigned deference to their
                    better judgment. I also <lb/>saw an improvement, which pleased me. We visited
                    the people <lb/>who were cutting and drying peaches in <rs type="place" role="visited">the missionaries’ garden</rs>.
                    <lb/>Formerly the fruit was laid upon a platform constructed of broom,
                    <lb/>fastened to, and supported by uprights fixed in the ground. If it
                    <lb/>rained long, the peaches were spoiled, as they could not be removed,
                    <lb/>and the platform itself suffered great damage during the wet season.
                    <lb/>The Brethren were now gradually introducing moveable racks or
                    <lb/>platforms, made of bamboo and reed wattling, and placed loose <lb/>on a
                    frame, which could be easily taken off, and with the load of <lb/>fruit carried
                    into a dry shed, and when not in use stowed away in <lb/>a small compass.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the forenoon, we met in conference. Thirty-four persons were
                    <lb/>appointed for advance in church-privileges, from a list of about fifty
                    <lb/>under consideration. After dinner, they were called by the chapel<lb

                    be admitted among the <lb/>candidates for baptism; then, the persons to be
                    baptized, and lastly, <lb/>some, who, having been baptized as children, were to
                    be received <lb/>into the congregation. After being informed of the advance they
                    <lb/>were to make, they were earnestly exhorted to walk worthy of the <lb/>grace
                    conferred upon them. The answers given to the very solemn <lb/>questions put to
                    them, were generally clear, and evidently proceed<pb n="81" break="no"/>

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-01-26">To-day</date> I attended a meeting of the men
                    for instruction in the <lb/>Christian doctrines, in which <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122701083">Father

                    catechisation, delivered a very animated <lb/>discourse. From <rs type="place" role="visited">the church</rs> I
                    proceeded to <rs type="place" role="visited">the school</rs>, where <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123420358">Bro<lb break="no"/>ther
                        Lemmerz</persName> was introduced to the boys as their future
                    school<lb/>master. They took leave of his predecessor, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456495">Brother
                        Leitner</persName>, and <lb/>promised obedience, by giving their hands. A
                    class was then <lb/>called, that I might hear them spell and read, which they
                    did very <lb/>well, considering that the vacation, during the harvest, always
                    <lb/>brings with it some forgetfulness of what has been learned. Some <lb/>of
                    the poor boys come to school in their karosses and aprons, others <lb/>are
                    dressed in linen jackets and <sic>trowsers</sic>. The school-house is a ve<lb
                        break="no"/>ry convenient, roomy building. As I had brought with me a
                    present <lb/>of bibles and testaments from the <orgName>British and Foreign
                        Bible Society</orgName>, <lb/>I took this opportunity of speaking to the
                    children, and observing, <lb/>that I should be glad, on my return, to be able to
                    inform that vener<lb/>able society, that they were well bestowed.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the evening, the Liturgy, or hymn, treating of our Saviour’s
                    <lb/>sufferings, appointed in our Church for Friday evening’s worship, <lb/>was
                    sung in a spirit of humble thankfulness for our redemption. <lb/>This is the
                    grand subject, which has proved the means of conver<lb/>sion, civilization, and
                    happiness in time and eternity, to believers of <lb/>every tribe and nation. May
                    it be and remain our constant theme, <lb/>in spite of either a deriding world,
                    or the vain conceits and specious <lb/>arguments of such, as pretend to superior
                    insight, and think that <lb/>they have found something higher and more
                    effectual.</p>
                <p><lb/>I have seen to-day much of the course of a missionary station, <lb/>where
                    there are many descriptions of persons to attend to; and I <lb/>am convinced,
                    that if a missionary does his duty, there is occasion <lb/>for the exertion of
                    all the energies of mind and body. May we al<lb/>ways be favoured with
                    missionaries, who can say with truth: “<hi rend="i"> The <lb/>Love of Christ
                        constraineth us.</hi>”</p>

                    After dinner, while others <lb/>were taking their African nap, which does not
                    yet agree with me, I <lb/>took a walk about the premises, and ascended <rs type="place" role="visited">the hill

                    from <lb/>whence a view might be taken of the missionaries’ premises,
                    show<lb/>ing the church, a part of every house, and the garden. On my

                    <lb/>who had just caught a tree-serpent. It was a beautiful creature, a<lb/>bout
                    four feet long, mottled grey on the back, with a gold-yellow <lb/>belly. These
                    reptiles are said to be very venomous, and haunt trees <lb/>and bushes. After a

                    in the prosperity <lb/>of this work of G<hi rend="smallcaps">OD</hi>. After an

                    by the questions put to, and answers given by the <lb/>parents, previous to the

                <p><lb/>To-day, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother Bonatz</persName> introduced to me a

                    distribute a<lb/>mong the poor, I presented him with a scarlet jacket, given me
                    <lb/>by a Bristol volunteer, which I happened to have among my store. <lb/>I
                    asked him to try it on, and as it fitted him well, told him that it <lb/>was
                    his, and suited him, as an English captain. He could hardly <lb/>believe, that

                    Hottentots, and abounding with wood <lb/>and water. It was also their opinion,
                    that several suitable situa<lb/>tions might be found on that river, and many
                    Hottentots from <lb/><placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> would be

                    them about the <lb/>best means of making a journey into the interior.</p>
                <p><lb/>Being desirous of penetrating as far as possible into <rs type="place" role="visited">the kloof</rs>, <lb/>the

                    accompanied me into it, <lb/>this afternoon, and as we were new-comers, we
                    enjoyed all the <lb/>pleasure expectation affords, in making a journey of
                    discovery. <lb/>We arrived at the spot, where <rs type="place" role="visited">the kloof is divided by three
                        round<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>topped hillocks, which are partially

                    the quantity of water, rushing in numberless cascades between <lb/>them, in all
                    directions. Here are some very picturesque groups <lb/>of brush-wood, rock, and
                    water, which would furnish interesting <lb/>subjects for the pencil of an able
                    artist.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the evening, I spent a very agreeable hour with <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father

                    He gave <lb/>me a detailed account of the troubles which he and his two worthy
                    <lb/>associates experienced, in the beginning of their labours in this

                    went so far as to hand <lb/>about a paper, to be signed by the neighbouring

                    <lb/>walked with me to an eminence, from which I could overlook a <lb/>great
                    part of the boundary of <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>.
                    There is indeed, to <lb/>appearance, a sufficient quantity of land, for every
                    purpose of cul<lb break="no"/>ture and pasturage; but of four thousand acres,
                    granted to the <lb/>Brethren by <orgName>Government</orgName>, the greater part
                    is barren, and incapa<lb break="no"/>ble of cultivation; or at least of that
                    description, that the expense <lb/>required to make it fit for use, would be
                    much greater than we <lb/>could well afford. <placeName role="visited"
                        >Stoffels-Kraal</placeName> is an ancient Hottentot station, <lb/>but now
                    forsaken. There is, however, some good land along a <lb/>small gully, now dry.
                    From hence we went to <rs type="place" role="visited">the farm of a <persName>wi<lb
                                break="no"/>dow, Mrs. Giebeler</persName></rs>, whom we did
                    not find at home. It is, like most <lb/>farms in this neighbourhood, an
                    assemblage of mean houses and <lb/>sheds, but the plantations are fine,
                    consisting of large peach orch<lb break="no"/>ards, and gardens, surrounded by
                    avenues of firs, and of groves of <lb/>various kinds of trees. This place
                    likewise belonged to a tribe <lb/>of Hottentots, but was taken from them, by a
                    species of robbery, <lb/>very common in former days, when for a few bottles of
                    brandy, or <lb/>some other trifling consideration, the best lands in their
                        posses<lb break="no"/>sion were purchased of them; and the

                    intoxication, led to some magistrate, by whom the <lb/>shameful bargain was
                    ratified. The poor fellow did not come to <lb/>his senses, till it was too late,
                    when he perceived with dismay, how <lb/>he had suffered himself, and his people
                    to be duped.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our road now led through a barren country. In about three <lb/>hours we

                    <lb/>conversation respecting the aim of our visit.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Linde</persName> seemed exactly to coincide in opinion with
                        <persName>Mr. <lb/>Teunis</persName>, as to the country on the <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Chamtoos-Revier</placeName>, but did not ad<lb break="no"
                    />vise us to attempt a settlement on the <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Kierbooms-Revier</placeName>. He was <lb/>not well disposed towards the
                    Caffres, but described them as a <lb/>people without faith, to whom the
                        <orgName>British Government</orgName> showed un<lb break="no"/>deserved
                    lenity.</p>
                <p><lb/>The rain ceasing for some time, after sun-set, I walked with
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124709145">Bro<lb break="no"/>ther Clemens</persName> to the river, and
                    found the rocky banks to consist of <lb/>the same ferruginous sand-stone, which
                    abounds everywhere. Here <lb/>and there, it seemed to rest on a bed of a species
                    of slate or Thon<lb break="no"/>schiefer, of a blue-grey colour.</p>
                <p><lb/>At supper, no beverage of any kind was on the table, and our host
                    <lb/>informed us, that he never drank either beer, wine, or spirits, but
                    <lb/>only water. I therefore called for water, when the slave-girl in
                    <lb/>waiting, brought me a slop-bason full, no glass being used in this
                    <lb/>house. The supper was abundant, and well dressed. The conver<lb break="no"
                    />sation turned upon some of the beasts of prey, haunting this coun<lb
                        break="no"/>try, when the Southland farmer gave an account of the depre<lb
                        break="no"/>dations lately committed by wolves and wild-dogs, in his
                        neigh<lb break="no"/>bourhood, the latter being numerous, between the
                    mountains and <pb n="89"/>

                    <lb/>the coast. <sic>Tygers</sic> are not often seen; they skulk about the
                        cattle<lb break="no"/>kraals, and in the woods, but wolves roam singly, all
                    over the downy <lb/>or heathy country. The wild-dogs go in packs, are very bold
                    and <lb/>mischievous, and will attack oxen, horses and sheep, in spite of
                    <lb/>watchmen and dogs. Both they and the wolves, attack always <lb/>either from
                    behind, or in flank, never in front, as a tyger does. <lb/>Serpents are more
                    dangerous to man. <persName>Mr. Linde</persName> related, that a
                    <lb/>wood-keeper he employed in the kloofs, had lately lost his life by <lb/>the
                    bite of a Berg-adder. He died before notice could reach his <lb/>master, and
                    assistance be sent, which was in about three hours. Not <lb/>long since, one of
                    his oxen was bitten, on the road, by a Puff-adder, <lb/>and died the same night.
                    The bite of the Nachtschlange, or night<lb break="no"/>serpent, is said by the
                    Hottentot poison-doctors, to be incurable. <lb/>It is a beautiful creature,
                    marked with dark blue or black, vermil<lb break="no"/>lion and yellow rings,
                    following each other from head to tail.</p>
                <p><lb/>Some time after supper, the ladies retired, but <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother
                        Bonatz</persName>
                    <lb/>and I received still much entertainment and information from our <lb/>host
                    and his guests, who were sensible, pleasant companions, till at <lb/>length we
                    requested to be shown into our bed-room. In passing <lb/>through an
                    anti-chamber, we found a Dutch folio bible, and a tes<lb break="no"/>tament in
                    octavo, lying on the window-seat. Both had been used, <lb/>the latter some time
                    ago, for it had lain so long with the leaves <lb/>upon the boards, that the
                    opened pages had assumed the colour of <lb/>the wood. As for the bible, one use
                    of long prefaces, introductory <lb/>exhortations, and other prolegomena, with
                    which these ancient edi<lb break="no"/>tions abound, was here rendered manifest,
                    for they had saved the <lb/>text of the Scriptures itself, as some of the family
                    had torn out the <lb/>greater part, both of the first and last leaves, and had
                    not yet reached <lb/>either Genesis or the Revelations, the latter being
                    defended by a <lb/>translation of Josephus’s account of the destruction of
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Jerusalem</placeName>. <lb/>Thus by a timely
                    remonstrance, I hope the bible itself, has been <lb/>saved. It was furnished
                    with very good prints, in the old Dutch <lb/>style of engraving.</p>

                    <lb/>to discover, how our hospitable landlord had provided for so many
                    <lb/>guests! We found <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124709145">Brother Clemens</persName> and <rs type="person" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123464045">his wife</rs>, lying
                    in one. <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123464537">Sister Kohrhammer</persName> in another, and a bedstead
                    for us, in a third <lb/>corner of the room. A square hole in the wall served for
                    a window. <lb/>A savoury supper, without any thing to drink, had created
                    sufficient <lb/>thirst, to keep our friends awake. They were eagerly expecting
                    <lb/>our arrival, as <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother Bonatz</persName> had the key of the
                    waggon-chest, <lb/>who was now called upon to administer a draught of wine and
                    <lb/>water to each of the party. Trying to open the shutter for air, it
                    <lb/>fell out, and as we could not leave the square hole open, for fear of
                    <lb/>a visit from some of the numerous dogs, which guarded the pre<lb break="no"
                    />mises, I had some trouble in recovering and fastening the shutter <lb/>again.
                    These operations, and the amusement occasioned by the <lb/>remarks made on the
                    accommodations afforded in the mansion of <lb/>an African ’squire, kept us some
                    time awake, and when at last I <lb/>attempted to join my friend in his narrow
                    couch, I found it utterly <lb/>impossible. I therefore put on my boots and great
                    coat, and sit<lb break="no"/>ting on the bed, leaning my head against the wail,
                    got a very sound <lb/>nap. To complete our happiness, we were all night
                    serenaded by <lb/>the cries of <persName>Mrs. Linde</persName>’s children, in an
                    adjoining apartment; and <lb/>roused early in the morning by the dying screams
                    of a poor pig, <lb/>which, as we were afterwards informed, was butchered, to
                    provide <lb/>us with a good breakfast. This was the first time I had spent a
                    <lb/>night in the enjoyment of African hospitality, and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Brother
                        Bonatz</persName>
                    <lb/>assured me; of what I was in the sequel sufficiently convinced, that
                    <lb/>it was much better, than I had to expect, when travelling into the
                    <lb/>interior. We were greeted by our cheerful host in the morning, <lb/>with
                    his hopes, that we had found ourselves comfortably lodged, <lb/>and which we
                    could answer in the affirmative without hypocrisy, for <lb/>his goodwill, and
                    desire to please us, made every thing bearable.</p>
                <p><lb/>He provided us with an excellent breakfast, broiled pork, omelets,
                    <lb/>eggs, tea and coffee, with milk and grapes in abundance, and <lb/>though
                    custom has excluded attention to what Englishmen call the <lb/>comforts, yet
                    there seems to be no want of the necessaries of life, <lb/>and no feeling of

                    <lb/>and elegance. We took leave of <persName>Mr. Linde</persName>, with
                    sentiments of <lb/>gratitude and esteem, having obtained from him sufficient
                        infor<lb break="no"/>mation respecting the country I was about to visit, and
                    proceeded to <lb/><placeName role="visited">Gaense-Kraal</placeName>, which at
                    some distance appeared very inviting with <lb/>groves of lofty oaks and pines.
                    We forded the <placeName role="visited">Sonderend</placeName> close to <lb/>the
                    farm, but on entering, found the building in a very dilapidated <lb/>state, and
                    the gardens much neglected. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123464537">Sister Kohrhammer</persName> was <lb/>also
                    here unsuccessful, in her endeavours to procure some articles of
                    <lb/>house-keeping, for <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>.</p>
                <p><lb/>We admired the oaks growing on these premises. They are an <lb/>additional
                    proof, that had the first settlers been attentive to the <lb/>growth of timber,
                    both for their own and their children’s sake, they <lb/>would now have had
                    timber and fuel sufficient, and not been under <lb/>the necessity of fetching
                    the former from <placeName role="mentioned">Plettenberg-bay</placeName>, and the
                        <lb/><placeName role="mentioned">Zitzikamma</placeName>,and of stripping the
                    country of its bushes, to procure the <lb/>latter. I am convinced, from the

                    many other places, that whole forests of oak and other useful <lb/>timber, might
                    be reared in a short space of time, wherever the soil <lb/>retains any moisture.
                    But it appears, as if neither the first settlers <lb/>nor their descendants, had
                    the least notion of providing for posterity. <lb/>Many answers given to me by
                    boors, otherwise intelligent, proved <lb/>that their only thought is, “What
                    shall we eat? What shall we drink, <lb/>and wherewith shall we be clothed? How
                    shall we increase our <lb/>herds of cattle, and leave to our children a set of

                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. William Teunis</persName> is an intelligent man. He had been

                <p><lb/>An old schoolmaster, who attended his children, hearing that we <lb/>were

                    at the en<lb break="no"/>trance of the kloof, and that a great many Hottentots,

                    this life in the faith of Christ. The boys’ school begins the pro<lb break="no"

                    descending into the grave, receive the <lb/>body from those above, and place it
                    in a recess, made on one side, <lb/>at the bottom. The service being concluded,
                    bushes or branches <lb/>of trees are put in as high as the top of the recess,
                    and the earth <lb/>thrown in upon them. Of the origin of this custom I could
                    obtain <lb/>no information, but as it is done with the greatest decency, the
                    <lb/>missionaries have wisely refrained from obliging the Hottentots to
                    <lb/>discontinue the practice of making a recess, and using the branches <lb/>or
                    bushes. Europeans are buried in the manner usual in <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Europe</placeName>, <lb/>and the service and liturgy are the same. In the
                    evening-meeting <lb/>of the whole missionary family, I communicated some recent
                    letters <lb/>from our Brethren in <placeName role="mentioned"

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-02-05">5th.</date> At a special conference, we took
                    into serious consideration, <lb/>the measures to be adopted in making a
                    reconnoitring journey into <lb/>the interior, and my proposal to take

                    approved. I had made some experience of <lb/>Cape travelling, sufficient to
                    discover, that it is no luxury; but I came <lb/>thither to serve the mission,
                    and not to seek my ease. I therefore <lb/>gladly entered upon this service,
                    though the only plan, which we <lb/>could form at present, was, to take our own
                    waggon and oxen, and <lb/>to purchase an additional spann, in the interior, to
                    help us along. <lb/>It will be seen by the narrative of that <sic>juorney</sic>,

                    <lb/>cious providence, we were enabled to perform it on a plan much <lb/>more
                    eligible and effective; without which, indeed, all our contriv<lb break="no"

                    in the best way.</p>
                <p><lb/>I resolved to go in a few days to <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Groenekloof</placeName>, and both there, <lb/>and at <placeName
                        role="mentioned">the Cape</placeName>, to make the needful arrangements, and
                    obtain <rs type="person">His <lb/>Excellency the Governor</rs>’s permission and
                    sanction. In the after<lb break="no"/>noon, I was busily employed in making a
                    drawing of the mission<lb break="no"/>aries’ premises from the hill to the
                    right, coming out of the kloof, <lb/>having lately found a situation from which
                    I could see some part of <lb/>every buikling belonging to them.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the evening, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName>, after a suitable
                    discourse, of<lb break="no"/>fered up a fervent prayer for the prosperity of the
                    work of God on <lb/>earth, particularly among the heathen, the Brethren having
                    here <lb/>followed the practice of other missionary societies in <placeName

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-02-06">6th.</date> I attended the instructions given by
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName> to a <lb/>person who was to be
                    confirmed, previous to her admission to the <lb/>Lord’s supper. I was greatly
                    edified and affected by the simplicity, <lb/>cordiality and genuine piety with
                    which this venerable man impart<lb break="no"/>ed his instruction to the
                    candidate, as well as with the attention and <lb/>devotion with which she
                    received it. At the conclusion, he offered <lb/>up a fervent prayer in her
                    behalf, and both he and his wife added <lb/>some suitable exhortations
                    respecting her future walk and conversa<lb break="no"/>tion, as a worthy
                    communicant, and child of God.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the afternoon, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123420358">Brother Lemmerz</persName> accompanied me to the

                        garden-grounds <lb/>belonging to the Hottentots</rs>. A little man,
                    very ill dressed, beckon<lb break="no"/>ed to us, inviting us to come into his
                    cottage and grounds. From his <lb/>appearance, I guessed him, to be one of
                    those, who were either too poor <lb/>or too indolent to provide better for
                    themselves and their families. <lb/>I was therefore preparing to impart some
                    friendly exhortation, when, <lb/>on stepping within the outer fence, to my

                    abundance. The <lb/>cottage was mean, and his children almost naked. On inquiry,
                    I <lb/>found, that he was very poor, and had only one suit of decent cloth<lb

                <p><lb/>To-day, I received a letter from <rs type="person"><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>, Government-surveyor

                    which highly delighted them. <lb/>I was surprised to find them not at all
                    puzzled by a representation <lb/>of this kind. They proved, that they understood
                    the picture, by <lb/>asking many sensible questions, showing more intelligence

                    We all alighted, and spent <lb/>a quarter of an hour together in conversation.
                    Our first halt was <lb/>at <rs type="place" role="visited">a farm, belonging to a

                    <lb/>my old friend, whom <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123464045">Sister Clemens</persName> and I had visited

                        (<ref>p. 56</ref>). Hither we had sent relay-horses <lb/>which were ready to
                    carry us forward. But I was in no hurry to <lb/>proceed, and had serious doubts,
                    whether exposing myself longer <lb/>to the rays of the sun were not sporting
                    with my health, for by <lb/>the time we reached this place, I felt quite
                    overcome with heat <lb/>and fatigue.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our host, however, treated us with so excellent a dish of tea, <lb/>which,
                    as he said, had been given him by an English traveller some <lb/>days ago, that
                    it greatly revived my spirits, and a plate of fine <lb/>grapes completed my
                    recovery. Having forded the bed of the <lb/>river, in which there was hardly a
                    few inches depth of water, we <lb/>reached the foot of a long hill called the

                    established a turnpike, to cover the expense of <lb/>mending the road across the
                    mountain, which formerly was very <lb/>rough and dangerous. We had resolved to

                    reached his place, as it was yet early, I <lb/>was disposed to proceed. The road
                    is in general pretty even, but <lb/>here and there carried along a steep slope,
                    which makes it danger<lb break="no"/>ous for a loaded waggon, if not driven with
                    great care. The view of <lb/>the mountains near <placeName role="visited_

                    <lb/>of their shapes forms a singular outline. After fording the <placeName

                    The ascent from the <lb/>east is rough, but not steep. The wildness of the

                    <lb/>for some time. The moon set, reddened by a kind of haze, which <lb/>by
                    degrees spread all over the sky, and covered the lower ran<lb break="no"/>ges of
                    hills, leaving no marks, by which we might discover our way <lb/>in the dark. We
                    now reached a place where two roads met, one <lb/>taking a westerly, and the
                    other a northerly direction. <persName>Solomon</persName>
                    <lb/>walked forward on each, and returned with very evident marks of <lb/>dismay
                    in his countenance. “Well <persName>Solomon</persName>,” said I, “which way
                    <lb/>are we to ride?” “Ah, Sir,” replied he, “I am lost. God must help <lb/>us!
                    Mynheer must decide, and we shall be right.” The roar of <lb/>the sea to
                    westward was now very distinct, and knowing, that to<lb break="no"/>wards that
                    quarter we could not err, I chose the western road, on <lb/>which we proceeded
                    with our weary horses for some time, till per<lb break="no"/>ceiving the light
                    of a fire, apparently at a short distance before us, <lb/>we made towards it,
                    and after much anxiety, the fire appearing and <lb/>vanishing by turns, as
                    though it fled from us, we at length arrived at <lb/>it. Here we found two
                    waggons, with two slaves sleeping on the <lb/>bare ground, to whom we were
                    announced by the barking of their <lb/>dogs. We dismounted, and turned the

                    finding a resting-place, exclaimed, “Well, I <lb/>“knew, that the road Mynheer

                    intersecting each other. The house is large, with <lb/>good rooms, and fitted up

                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456495">Brother Leitner</persName>, <lb/>to see the Hottentots making
                    unburnt bricks. The clay of this <lb/>country hardens to such a degree, that a
                    brick made of it, and <lb/>well dried in the sun, is more difficult to break,
                    than many a stone. <lb/>In the afternoon was the funeral of the poor drowned
                    child, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456495">Bro<lb break="no"/>ther Leitner</persName> delivered a very

                    to listen to the music. I told them, that I would play <lb/>for <hi rend="i"
                        >them</hi>, but they should sing for <hi rend="i">me</hi>, as I wished to
                    ascertain, <lb/>whether, by the help of an instrument, they would keep true to
                    <lb/>the tune, without sinking their voices. They then gave out, and <lb/>sung
                    some verses, in different tunes; I always found them true <lb/>to the pitch of
                    the instrument, though every now and then I let <lb/>them sing some lines by
                    themselves, then falling in with the piano<lb break="no"/>forte, found they had
                    not in the smallest degree lowered their <lb/>voices. The number of singers
                    gradually increased to thirty. I <lb/>was pleased with this new proof of the
                    naturally musical qualities <lb/>of this nation, and was convinced, that the
                    sinking of the voices at <lb/>church, is only owing to bad precentors, but would
                    be prevented <lb/>by an organ.</p>
                <p><lb/>After our evening-worship, the spirit of singing seemed to come <lb/>upon

                        <persName>Leonhard Paerl</persName>. The latter had lately been re-admitted,
                    <lb/>having returned to <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> after
                    long absence. Like many <lb/>other Hottentots, he had ever been extremely fond
                    of roving, and <lb/>could not well endure to remain long in one place. Several
                    years <lb/>ago, hearing on his tramps some account of <placeName

                    were instructed in the word of God, curiosity <lb/>led him to visit that
                    settlement. He heard the gospel with atten<lb break="no"/>tion, and it pleased
                    God to awaken his heart and show him the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of
                    conversion. At his request, he obtained leave to live <lb/>there, and as he
                    conducted himself soberly, there was no intention <lb/>on the part of the
                    Missionaries to send him away; but he could not <lb/>long bear to be confined,
                    in attending to a field and garden. After <lb/>many shorter wanderings, he
                    absented himself for three whole years, <lb/>and, during that time, had
                    traversed the whole colony from east to <lb/>west, visiting all places of which
                    he obtained any information; till <lb/>at length, weary of a vagabond life, he
                    returned to <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>, and <lb/>having
                    anew obtained permission to reside, began seriously to make <lb/>the concerns of

                <p><lb/>On account of his general knowledge of every part of the co<lb break="no"

                <p><lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>, having brought his own travelling-waggon
                    from <placeName role="mentioned">Capetown</placeName>, and the <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> waggon, originally destined for the
                    journey as before mentioned, proving too small and inconvenient, we put the
                    baggage into the latter, and gave charge of it to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456933">Brother
                        Stein</persName>, who willingly accepted of that honourable post, and took
                    his seat in the baggage-waggon. The rest of us occupied the seats in the lighter
                    vehicle.</p>
                <p><lb/>It may not be improper, in this place, to give a more detailed ac<lb
                        break="no"/>count of the mode of travelling in <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >South Africa</placeName>, especially as some <lb/>of my readers may be
                    surprised to hear, that so many arrangements <lb/>were required, to undertake
                    the proposed reconnoitring journey. In <lb/><placeName role="mentioned"
                        >England</placeName>, indeed, or even on the continent of <placeName

                    superfluous, as travellers find everywhere inns, <lb/>provisions, and other
                    necessaries. But it is far otherwise in this <lb/>country. Here are no inns, and
                    in those farm-houses, in which a <lb/>traveller may sometimes, but not always,
                    find quarters for the night, <lb/>provisions are often scarce, and stores not to
                    be purchased. In <lb/>some, not even a room can be had for the party to sleep
                    in, much <lb/>less beds and other conveniencies. Every thing necessary for the

                    <lb/>expedition, must therefore be provided, calculating upon the time
                    <lb/>required for it. Thus, if more be in company, and the journey <lb/>long, a
                    baggage-waggon is essentially wanted. There are no post<lb break="no"/>houses,
                    where horses may be hired. Travellers must therefore have <lb/>their own horses,
                    or oxen. The latter are by far the most useful <lb/>animals for travelling in
                    this country, for no expense attends the <lb/>feeding of them, as they pick
                    their own provender in the wilderness, <lb/>where they either find grass, or eat
                    the tender sprout of the rhino<lb break="no"/>ceros, and other bushes, generally
                    refusing hay or corn, if even set <lb/>before them: whereas, if horses or mules
                    are employed, a sufficient <lb/>stock of the latter must be provided.</p>
                <p><lb/>Many travellers sleep in their waggons, but we found it more com<lb
                        break="no"/>fortable, to put up a tent. Cooking utensils are likewise
                    necessary, as <lb/>all victuals must be dressed in the fields, unless it
                    happens, that a <lb/>dinner or supper may be had at a farm-house, where the
                    people are <lb/>able and willing to entertain and lodge strangers. The roads
                    being <lb/>in many places excessively bad, stony, and steep, more cattle are
                    <lb/>wanted than on roads regularly made and kept in repair. There <lb/>are even
                    places, where more than twenty oxen must be employed to <lb/>drag the waggons up
                    the precipitous ascent, and where horses would <lb/>scarcely be of use. From
                    this account it is plain, that arrangements, <lb/>very different from what are
                    required in <placeName role="mentioned">Europe</placeName>, are necessary for
                    <lb/>a journey in <placeName role="mentioned">South Africa</placeName>.</p>
                <p><lb/>A team or set of oxen or horses put to a waggon, is called by the <lb/>Dutch
                    a <hi rend="i">Spann</hi>, and those places in the wilderness, where halt is
                    <lb/>made and the oxen unyoked, an <hi rend="i">Outspann-place</hi>. As this is
                    a con<lb/>venient word for the purpose, I am glad to be authorized by the
                    <lb/>journals of other English travellers, to retain it. The oxen are left,
                    <lb/>from two to four hours, to seek their food and get rest, while the
                    <lb/>travelling party cook their victuals and take their meals.</p>

                    <lb/>to sixteen oxen, and a light travelling waggon, from eight to <lb/>twelve.
                    Besides the Hottentot driver, who, sitting on the box, <lb/>directs the whole
                    spann, without reins, merely by means of his long <lb/>whip, there is always a
                    man, or sometimes only a little boy em<lb/>ployed, as a leader. (See p. 39). The
                    heathen Hottentots have no <lb/>mercy upon their draught oxen, and the skin of
                    most of them, is <lb/>cut in all directions by their whips, so as to present to
                    the eye the <lb/>resemblance of net-work. They drive and ride their horses and
                    <lb/>mules, with equal want of feeling, and it is well for them, that the
                    <lb/>Cape horses are a very hardy race. Nor is it without much teaching,
                    <lb/>even after they have become Christians, that they are convinced <lb/>of the
                    impropriety of such usage of dumb animals, and learn that <lb/>Christian lesson
                    “Be ye merciful, as your Heavenly Father also is <lb/>merciful,” Luke, vi. 36".
                    “A righteous man regardeth the life of his <lb/>beast, but the tender mercies of
                    the wicked are cruel,” Prov. xii. <lb/>10. We took three saddle-horses with us,
                    to be used, as occasion <lb/>might require, in examining the country.</p>
                <p><lb/>Thus equipped, we proceeded with tolerable speed. About one <lb/>hundred and
                    fifty Hottentots, who accompanied us out of<placeName role="visited"

                    of the whole chain, as seen from a field above <lb/>the farm, but found the
                    sun’s heat almost intolerable. To exhibit, <lb/>by a drawing, the characteristic
                    features of a country, it is of most <lb/>consequence, that the shape of its
                    hills should be delineated with <lb/>the strictest accuracy, and the features of
                    the African ranges are too <lb/>singular, not to attract attention. The few
                    sketches I have inserted <lb/>in this work, may, I trust, be pronounced
                    scrupulously exact, as to <lb/>outline, which is all the merit to which I lay
                    any claim.</p>
                <p><lb/>While we were at dinner, the infant daughter of a relation of the
                    <lb/>family, who had been long ailing, unexpectedly died in the nurse’s
                    <lb/>arms. This event threw the ladies into great agitation, nor did
                        <persName>Mr. <lb/>Von Helsland</persName>’s kind and consoling exhortations
                    to resignation seem <lb/>to have much effect. They all retired to their own
                    rooms, and we <lb/>were very sorry, not to be able to express our gratitude,
                    both <lb/>for the kindness and hospitality, with which we had been
                    enter<lb/>tained, and for a considerable present of grapes, apples, dried peas
                    <lb/>and beans, fowls, tongues, and other provisions, which, by <persName>Mr.
                        Von <lb/>Helsland</persName>’s orders, had been conveyed into the waggons,
                    for our use.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Von Helsland</persName> is a native of <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Flanders</placeName>. Having spent the <lb/>early part of
                    his life at college, and travelled into various parts of <lb/><placeName
                        role="mentioned">Europe</placeName>, he made several voyages to the

                        role="mentioned">the Cape</placeName>, <lb/>as Captain of a Danish
                    East-India-man, and, after a life of great <lb/>activity and usefulness, settled
                    in this country. He is a man of <lb/>the most polished manners, speaks English
                    fluently, and can con<lb/>verse in German, Danish, and Latin, with ease. The
                    family spend <lb/>the summer on his farm, but in winter reside at <placeName

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-03-07">7th.</date> We had not proceeded far, before we
                    were stopped by a <lb/>boor on horseback. He came on full speed, jumped of his
                    horse <lb/>close to our waggon, shook hands with each of the party, and
                    ob<lb/>served, that we had a Hottentot with us, <persName>Lebrecht
                        Aris</persName>, who was <lb/>bound by a regular contract made with him, to
                    come and work at <lb/>his farm, immediately after New-year, but had not made his
                    appear<lb/>ance. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> ordered
                        <persName>Lebrecht</persName> to come forward. The <lb/>boor no sooner saw
                    him, than his whole countenance changed from <lb/>affected friendliness, to that
                    of an infuriated demon. He began to <lb/>rave at the poor Hottentot, without
                    permitting him to utter a word <lb/>in his own defence. Never in my life have I
                    heard Dutch spoken <lb/>with such fluency. As his rage increased with every
                    sentence, the <lb/>guttural sounds of that elegant language, seemed to proceed
                    deeper <lb/>and deeper from the bottom of his throat. At length, almost
                    <lb/>breathless with exertion, he turned to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother
                    Schmitt</persName>, and de<lb/>manded, whether he would give up the man. On
                    being answered in <lb/>the negative, he mounted his horse, and gallopped off to
                    <rs type="place" role="mentioned">the Veld<lb/>cornet’s house</rs>, which lay in sight and near the road. We followed
                    <lb/>quietly, and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> going up to the door with
                        <persName>Lebrecht</persName>, <lb/><rs type="person">the Veldcornet</rs>, on examination, being
                    doubtful as to the validity <lb/>of the contract, thought proper to suffer the
                    Hottentot to accom<lb/>pany us, but promised the boor, that after our return, he
                    might <lb/>claim his services. Poor <persName>Lebrecht</persName> stood
                    dumbfounded, nor would <lb/>the boor suffer him to speak. It was to us a very
                    unpleasant adven<lb/>ture, not only because it occasioned delay, but as the
                    character of <lb/>our Hottentots was implicated.</p>
                <p><lb/>This instance, however, was one among many, which shows the in<lb/>justice
                    sometimes done to these poor people, if left without protec<lb/>tion to the
                    mercy of the boors; and here it may be proper to antici<lb/>pate, by giving an
                    explanation of the business, as it appeared, on <lb/>examination, before the

                <p><lb/><persName>Lebrecht Aris</persName> owed twelve dollars to a farmer, in the
                    neighbour<lb/>hood of <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>, and
                    not having the means to pay, engaged <lb/>with the boor above-mentioned to work
                    six months on his farm, <lb/>at two dollars per month and his cost, on
                    condition, that the boor <lb/>should immediately discharge his debt. He had
                    worked two <lb/>months, when his creditor again called on him, and threatened
                    <lb/>him with imprisonment, unless he immediately paid the twelve <lb/>dollars.
                    In his distress, he applied to a missionary, who lent <lb/>him the money, for
                    the payment of which he received a regular <lb/>receipt from his creditor. This
                    receipt the poor man had in his <lb/>pocket, but being nearly frightened out of
                    his senses, by the <lb/>violence of the boor’s behaviour, he forgot to produce
                    it at <rs type="person">the <lb/>Veldcornet</rs>’s. After discovering the boor’s neglect to fulfil his
                    en<lb/>gagement to pay his creditor, he now not only refused to work <lb/>any
                    longer with so faithless an employer, but had a demand upon <lb/>him for four
                    dollars, being two month’s pay. The boor, however, <lb/>most unjustly insisted
                    on his serving him the remaining four <lb/>months, under pretence of a contract.
                    But no written agreement <lb/>having been made and signed, in presence of a
                    Veldcornet, which <lb/>is required to bind a Hottentot to his employer, for any
                    stated <lb/>time, <rs type="person">the Veldcornet</rs> discharged him for the present, without
                    fur<lb/>ther explanation. <persName>Lebrecht</persName>, after recovering his
                    spirits, stated <lb/>his case satisfactorily to us, and on our return, I
                    submitted it to <lb/><rs type="person">the landdrost of <placeName role="mentioned"
                            >Zwellendam</placeName></rs>, who sent a proper reproof to the
                    unjust boor.</p>
                <p><lb/>Near this place, we first met with the great thorn-bush, a mimosa, <lb/>with
                    which many parts of the country are nearly covered. It has <lb/>thorns from four
                    to six inches long. They are placed two and two, <lb/>in an obtuse angle, of
                    about ninety degrees ; out of the inner centre <lb/>of which proceeds, from a
                    bud, a number of small pinnated leaves, <lb/>resembling the acacia. The flower
                    is yellow, and consists of a great <lb/>number of small leaves placed in a
                    globular form. The shape of <lb/>the tree is very elegant.</p>
                <p><lb/>After a hot ride, we pitched our tent upon a waste called <placeName

                    its shade from the burning rays of the sun. Before us <lb/>appeared some of the
                    lower class of hills, through which a gap <lb/>admits the river <placeName

                    insupportable, and the inside of the tent <lb/>like an oven. All the butter
                    melted, and on attempting to <lb/>finish some sketches, the colour dried
                    instantly on the paper, <lb/>without permitting any washing. I found at length

                    <lb/>writing my diary, though the ink dried so fast within my pen, <lb/>that I
                    could hardly proceed. About <date when-iso="1816-03-07T18:00">six in the evening</date>, we left <lb/>this place, which,

                    pleasant farm. Its banks are very steep, and in some <lb/>places formed of
                    perpendicular rocks, resembling mud-walls in <lb/>colour. Having forded another
                    smaller stream of brackish wa<lb/>ter, we halted on a waste, with a woody dell

                    began to cover their tops. In a short time, <lb/>we were enveloped in a dense

                    rea<lb/>diness to lend every assistance in promoting an object, to which he
                    <lb/>had always shown the most favourable disposition, and was glad to <lb/>be
                    thus authorized to act consistently with his own inclinations, in <lb/>affording
                    every facility to our undertaking. He immediately pro<lb/>posed to give me a

                    <lb/>disposed to accept of <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs>’s generous offer, considering
                    my<lb/>self not entitled to such distinction, and disliking the idea of
                    be<lb/>coming burdensome to the farmers, by pressing their men <lb/>and cattle
                    into our service, perhaps with injury or inconvenience to them<lb/>selves. On
                    both these subjects, however, <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs> satisfied my <lb/>mind, particularly
                    by stating, that the farmers received a <lb/>sufficient consideration for
                    services thus performed, and had no reason to <lb/>complain, since the
                        <orgName>English Government</orgName> had ruled the colony. It <lb/>was our
                    intention to have purchased a spann at this place, a measure <lb/>which was now
                    superseded ; and as we could spare at least one of <lb/>our Hottentots,
                        <persName>old Christian Hector</persName>, was sent home with the spann
                    <lb/>we had hired at <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>.
                        <rs type="person_group">Mr. and Mrs. <persName>Von Buissini</persName></rs> insisted <lb/>upon our taking
                    up our abode at their house, and treated us with <lb/>every mark of kindness and
                    hospitality.</p>
                <p><lb/>The drosty is a substantial, spacious, well-furnished mansion, and <lb/>the
                    premises much improved by the present landdrost. The town <lb/>or village lies
                    scattered, and consists of several single houses or rows <lb/>of buildings,
                    connected with each other, without much regularity. <lb/>The church is a neat
                    plain structure, without a tower. The num<lb/>ber of inhabitants is said to be
                    about three hundred. The situa<lb/>tion of <placeName role="mentioned"

                    <lb/>mountains, whose rocky summits assume all manner of singular <lb/>shapes.
                    Two peaks, like truncated cones, form their principal <lb/>feature, and the
                    kloofs and beds of torrents, with which their steep <lb/>sides are furrowed,
                    have an almost terrific appearance. Parallel to <lb/>their foot runs a range of
                    low round hills, some of which are rocky, <lb/>others, clothed with verdure.</p>

                    drivers in haste to <lb/>proceed. Having been advised to take our own spann with
                    us as a <lb/>reserve, we appointed <persName>Lebrecht Aris</persName> to the

                    burst into a flood of tears, exclaim<lb/>ing, “This, indeed, is in answer to my

                    to the next station at the <placeName role="mentioned">Groot Vader’s
                        Bosch</placeName>. They were <lb/>civil, good-humoured people, and drove at
                    a brisk rate, often at <lb/>a sharp trot. The road was good, the weather
                    pleasant, clear, <lb/>and cool, and our party in excellent spirits. As we left
                        <placeName role="visited">Zwellen<lb/>dam</placeName>, the views to the
                    south became more extensive, and the <lb/>mountains to the north assumed a
                    milder character, till the view <lb/>of the high range was intercepted by lower
                    hills.</p>
                <p><lb/>Farms are not numerous in this part of the country. We crossed <lb/>several
                    brooks, and regretted to see a good deal of water, that pre<lb/>cious
                    fructifying agent in this dry land, running to waste, though <lb/>the valleys
                    appeared capable of culture. But the land allotted <lb/>to each farm occupies so
                    large a tract of country, and labourers <lb/>are so scarce, that some apology
                    may be made for the inhabitants. <lb/>Since the slave-trade has been abolished,
                    and the slaves remaining <lb/>in the colony are sold at an enormous price,

                    <lb/>skilled in any art, the services of Hottentots are more wanted in <lb/>the
                    cultivation of the land. Thus they have been taught, better <lb/>to know their
                    own value, and will no longer submit to the treat<lb/>ment they formerly
                    received. Being both by Dutch and English <lb/>laws a free nation, they cannot
                    be compelled to serve an unjust <lb/>or tyrannical master, and it is solely
                    owing to their natural <lb/>indolence, that many of them remain in poverty and
                    misery. <lb/>The effect of Christian instruction contributes most towards
                    rais<lb/>ing them from the abject and wretched state, into which they had
                    <lb/>been plunged, by gradually changing their dispositions, and <lb/>making
                    them obedient, not only to the precepts of the Gospel, <lb/>but to all those
                    moral and civil obligations which it inculcates, <lb/>as they are successively
                    explained to them by their teachers.</p>
                <p><lb/>About an English mile above <rs type="place" role="visited_nearby">a pleasant
                        farm, called <placeName>Rotter<lb/>dam</placeName></rs>, we arrived at <placeName

                    cover<lb/>ing both banks near the ford consist chiefly of the mimosa.
                    <lb/>Having crossed the river, we turned to the left, out of the <lb/>main road,
                    under a hill, the ascent of which was covered with a <lb/>profusion of large
                    aloes. This was the first time we had seen <lb/>this singular plant growing in
                    such abundance.</p>
                <p><lb/>The vale of the <placeName role="visited_nearby">Zuurbrack</placeName> is,
                    at its entrance from the west, nar<lb/>row and full of wood. The <placeName

                    <lb/>to side between steep banks, and must be forded twice, before <placeName
                        role="visited">the <lb/>missionary Institution</placeName> can be
                    approached. A few Hottentot wo<lb/>men, imitating the custom at <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>, came out to meet us, <lb/>and
                    walking alongside of the waggons, bid us welcome with a hymn. <lb/>The valley
                    widens near the settlement, and appears to be a spot <lb/>well chosen for the
                    purposes of such an institution. We were re<lb/>ceived by <rs type="person_group">Mr. and Mrs.
                    <persName>Seidenfaden</persName></rs>, her mother, and brother, and <lb/>his assistant, <persName>Mr. Wimmer</persName>, with
                    great kindness. After some con<lb/>versation and refreshment, we proceeded to
                    see <rs type="place" role="visited"><persName>Mr. Seidenfaden</persName>’s
                        <lb/>gardens</rs>, which are well laid out. <date notBefore-iso="1816-03-09T13:00">After dinner</date>, we walked

                    <lb/>them we entered, and conversed with the inhabitants. They were
                    <lb/>friendly, and expressed their thankfulness for the instruction they
                    <lb/>receive, and for the zeal with which the missionaries endeavour to
                    <lb/>promote their temporal and spiritual welfare.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Seidenfaden</persName> is a man of an active, benevolent mind,
                    and <lb/>generous spirit. He has himself built a good substantial house,
                    <lb/>with a spacious hall, in which he meets his congregation, and keeps
                    <lb/>school with the children and young people. <orgName>The Missionary
                        <lb/>Society in London</orgName>, under whose direction he acts, have not as
                    yet <lb/>thought proper to build a church in this place, and the small sum
                    <lb/>he could raise for the purpose, proved quite inadequate to the
                    <lb/>undertaking. A beginning, however, was made on an eminence <lb/>near the
                    house, but his expectations failing, the work remains un<lb/>finished. He
                    appears to deserve more encouragement, for the <lb/>situation is such, that in
                    time a considerable settlement might be <lb/>formed.</p>
                <p><lb/>After a pleasant stay of about four hours with this worthy family, <lb/>we
                    set out for the next station, accompanied by <persName>Mr.
                        Seidenfaden</persName>
                    <lb/>and <rs type="person">his brother-in-law</rs> on horseback, to direct us in crossing the
                    <lb/>river, the banks of which are so very steep, that all the skill of
                    <lb/>Hottentots in driving was required, to bring the wagoons and oxen
                    <lb/>safely through the water. At one of the fords, an ox, becoming <lb/>wild,
                    disengaged himself from the yoke. But we were in a most <lb/>romantic place, in
                    which some detention was not unpleasant. <lb/>While the Hottentots were pursuing
                    the frightened beast, the <lb/>waggons remaining stationary in the midst of the
                    stream, we con<lb/>templated with delight the surrounding scenery. To the right,
                    <lb/>the water rushed forward between steep, woody banks, in the deep <lb/>shade
                    of overspreading trees, towards a range of Ioav hills, enclos<lb/>ing the valley
                    to the south. To the left, rose a dark, gloomy forest, <lb/>ascending a deep
                    kloof, between perpendicular rocks, and stretch<lb/>ing along the foot of the
                    mountains, whose tops were enveloped in <lb/>black clouds, rendered more
                    frowning, as contrasted with the splen<lb/>dour of a bright sun in the west,

                    <lb/>The river seemed to fly from the dark recesses of the kloof towards <lb/>a
                    milder region. Close by the ford lay the skeleton of an ox; <lb/>wolves,
                    jackals, and tygers, having feasted on its flesh, of which but <lb/>little was
                    left for <persName>Mr. Seidenfaden</persName>’s large dog. This fine animal had <lb/>accompanied us,
                    and now improved the opportunity of making a <lb/>meal of the remainder; for the
                    dogs belonging to African farmers <lb/>and Hottentots are not regularly fed, but
                    live upon what they find. <lb/>Having secured the wild ox, we proceeded, and
                    soon took leave of <lb/>our worthy friends, who returned to <placeName role="mentioned">Zuurbrack</placeName>, with our
                    best wishes <lb/>and prayers for God’s blessing to rest upon their labours.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our road lay through the valley, and as long as it was light, we
                    <lb/>feasted our eyes on the delightful scenery, till we reached <rs type="place"

                        Van Ass</persName> made <lb/>many difficulties, complaining, that it put him
                    to great inconve<lb/>nience to harbour and forward us on our journey ; that he
                    had no <lb/>beds, and could render us no assistance in providing supper; though
                    <lb/>there were ten or more slaves and Hottentot maids in his kitchen,

                    gratis, <lb/>with milk and bread for our journey. For a fine fat sheep,
                        <persName>Mr. <lb/>Snyman</persName> was satisfied to take two Gnadenthal

                    recommended them <lb/>to the inhabitants of the colony. From hence we travelled
                    through <lb/>a bushy country, with a vast variety of flowering shrubs and
                    plants, <lb/>many of which we brought into the waggons to examine. They
                    <lb/>afforded us great gratification, though our want of knowledge in
                    <lb/>botany made it impossible to describe them. After a ride of <lb/>nearly

                    which here has a <lb/>sandy bed, enclosed between low, heathy hills. The descent

                    had received orders to furnish oxen. But we were again <lb/>disappointed, and
                    obliged to encamp. The plain was almost cov<lb break="no"/>ered with a species

                    being well acquainted with <lb/>every part of the district, his information was
                    of much use to us, but <lb/>he gave us no hopes of finding any unoccupied land

                    accompanied me into the yard, where we sought in vain for <lb/>the proprietor.
                    Only one Hottentot maid seemed left in charge of <lb/>the premises. Half a
                    hundred geese, and as many ducks, turkies, <lb/>and fowls, having probably been
                    accustomed to be fed about this <lb/>time, came running and flying towards us,
                    all cackling and crying <lb/>out for food. They followed us to the waggons, and
                    we could not <lb/>refuse a meal to such hungry supplicants.</p>
                <p><lb/>Having left our orders for a relay, we proceeded towards the <lb/>river,
                    which was nearly dry, and pitched our tent for the night. <lb/>The moon shone
                    bright, but the air was very cold. The Hottentots, <lb/>therefore, after making
                    a hearty meal, retired into the waggons to <lb/>sleep.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-03-14">14th.</date> Early, we were disturbed by a great
                    bleating of oxen and <lb/>other noises close to the tent. We rose to see what
                    was the mat<lb break="no"/>ter, and perceived, that about fifty head of cattle,
                    passing on to a graz<lb break="no"/>ing place, according to their usual custom,
                    greeted the strangers. <lb/>Being tethered to the waggons, and not able to
                    follow, the latter <lb/>answered by moans, expressive of their disappointment,
                    some even <lb/>making serious attempts to disengage themselves. This serenade
                    <lb/>broke our rest, and prepared us for an early departure. No oxen <lb/>being
                    furnished by the farmer, we detained those we had in posses<lb break="no"/>sion,

                    surely to a man on the brink of the grave, must <lb/>be of most importance, the
                    love of God in Christ Jesus. The poor <lb/>old man seemed to listen with
                    eagerness, while the missionary ex<lb break="no"/>plained to him the way of

                    peace and bliss. <lb/>This the poor old Hottentot promised to do.</p>
                <p><lb/>We now proceeded towards <placeName role="mentioned">Mossel-Bay</placeName>,
                    and got on with speed. <lb/>The country through which we travelled, was

                    the store-keeper. He <lb/>is by birth a Dane. While dinner was preparing, I took
                    a walk <lb/>to the sea-shore. The rocks consist chiefly of sand-stone, colour<lb

                <p><lb/>Not being able to obtain any oxen, we were under the necessity of

                    showed us the <lb/>premises, and went with us into <rs type="place" role="visited">the king’s store-house</rs>, built

                    The coasts of the bay are <lb/>bushy, and aloes grow in great abundance on the

                    <lb/>a price sufficiently high to make it a lucrative trade; but at
                    <lb/>present, since the article has become more common, and the <lb/>price

                    <date when-iso="1816-03-15T08:00">eight</date> it <lb/>cleared up, though the thunder continued to roar all round the
                        hori<lb break="no"/>zon. Our friendly host, at breakfast, gave us an account
                    of the <lb/>many wild beasts that haunt the woods and bushy coasts of the bay,
                    <lb/>where they have good cover. Tygers and wolves now and then <lb/>commit
                    depredations; wild buffaloes are sometimes seen; but wild <lb/>dogs are numerous
                    and most to be dreaded. A wolf hunts only at <lb/>night, is cowardly, and may be
                    guarded against, by various means; <lb/>but the wild dogs go in troops, and hunt
                    night and day. They <lb/>attack every living animal, and the “dread of man” is
                    but slight <lb/>upon them. <persName>Mr. Meyer</persName> related, that if they
                    have killed a tame <lb/>animal, they will quit it, on being attacked by man, but
                    not, if <lb/>their prey is wild game. Not long ago, a troop of them hunted a
                    <lb/>rehbock into his neighbour’s yard. The farmer sallied forth with <lb/>his
                    gun to drive off the pursuers, and secure the fugitive for his own <lb/>table,
                    but was instantly attacked by the dogs, and his life with dif<lb break="no"
                    />ficulty saved by his people. Porcupines are numerous; serpents <lb/>creep into
                    the poultry-yards and houses and do much mischief. Our <lb/>host getting up in
                    the dark, and walking into the hall, felt something <lb/>like a rope about his
                    legs. On culling for a light, he discovered it <lb/>to be a yellow serpent. Had
                    he accidentally trod upon it, he would <lb/>have been bitten by the venomous
                    reptile.</p>
                <p><lb/>About <date when-iso="1816-03-15T09:00">nine o’clock</date>, we took leave of the family. Nowhere have <lb/>we yet

                    <lb/>by charming little glens and coves, filled with luxuriant bushes and
                    <lb/>many aloes. A pleasant brook ran winding down the vale. But we <lb/>had not
                    long enjoyed the delightful scenery among these interesting <lb/>and
                    ever-varying hills and dales, before black clouds came sweeping <lb/>along their
                    summits with lightning, thunder, and rain. When the <lb/>rain ceased, and the
                    sun began again to shine upon us, the air was <lb/>filled with millions of small
                    flying ants, each having four wings. <lb/>Many fell upon our clothes, and stuck
                    to the wet coverings of the <lb/>waggons, while the main army passed over us, in
                    appearance like a <lb/>cloud of dust. From the hills, we descended into a grassy
                    plain <lb/>with a ridge of higher mountains before us. On a peak in the
                    <lb/>fore-ground stood two remarkable rocks, shaped so as to resemble
                    <lb/>decayed castles. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> and

                    but in vain. After fording the <placeName role="visited">Little <lb/>Sout

                <p><lb/>From hence we sent our old groom, <persName>Leonhard</persName>, to

                        <lb/>house</rs>, where oxen had been ordered for us, to desire that
                    they <lb/>might meet us on the banks of the river. The old man gave such an

                    farmer was <lb/>soon awed into compliance, and sent his son with the beasts,
                    with <lb/>an apology for not waiting upon us in person. This was the first
                    <lb/>time, that the requisition for relays had perfectly succeeded.</p>
                <p><lb/>The vale, in which we had halted, pleased us much, and ap<lb break="no"

                    occupied, we were informed, that in the rainy season it is <lb/>turned into a
                    lake, by the overflowing of the river. In all direc<lb break="no"/>tions the
                    scenery is beautiful. Towards the estuary, the low hills <lb/>consist of white

                    mica, in small fragments of granite. <lb/>The quartz was of a bluish hue, the
                    feldspath brown, and in <lb/>some stones mixed with hornblend and shoerl. On

                    <lb/>hurried swiftly amidst rocky shores, and impenetrable thickets, <lb/>which
                    rose to the brow of the hill. A smaller stream glided <lb/>more gently down the
                    right-hand deeper glen, in which a con<lb break="no"/>siderable quantity of
                    large timber shaded its dark recesses. The <lb/>descent into it was, in many
                    places, almost perpendicular, with <lb/>rocks richly clothed with beautiful
                    creepers, the crevises afford<lb break="no"/>ing nourishment to their roots, and
                    to those of a vast variety of <lb/>shrubs and trees. Our walk up the hill was

                    the hilly <lb/>country we had left behind.</p>
                <p><lb/>Having gained the summit, we arrived at an extensive, grassy <lb/>plain,

                    travelled along a smooth road, till an unexpected steep de<lb break="no"/>scent
                    seemed to arrest our progress. A rapid brook, fed by num<lb break="no"/>berless
                    small streams, precipitating themselves in cascades, from <lb/>the steep and
                    rocky banks, rushed wildly through the bottom of <lb/>the glen.</p>
                <p><lb/>Having overtaken a waggon with fourteen oxen, with a family <lb/>travelling

                    neither party strove to take precedence of the <lb/>other, but each offered to

                    led us to another grassy plain, <lb/>intersected by two narrow and rocky glens,

                    spacious enough to harbour so large a party he proposed, <lb/>that we should put

                    however, did not begin till <date when-iso="1816-03-15T21:00">nine <lb/>o’clock</date>, to give the Hottentots time to
                    return from their work in <lb/>the neighbouring farms. Mean-while, the time was
                    agreeably <lb/>spent in conversation. At <date when-iso="1816-03-15T21:00">nine</date>, the people were called together
                    <lb/>by the sound of a cow’s horn, blown by a maid-servant, in place <lb/>of a
                    bell. About a hundred men and women attended. The men and wo<lb break="no"/>men
                    sit separate, as in most foreign churches, on <lb/>benches, and are addressed
                    from a table and desk, as with us. <lb/>The chapel is a temporary building, with
                    one door at the gable<lb break="no"/>end. By a judicious arrangement, therefore,
                    on leaving it, the <lb/>women go out first, then the men, and the minister
                    follows. The <lb/>service consisted of two hymns, an exposition of a portion of
                        scrip<lb break="no"/>ture, which this evening was the beginning of our

                    that true conviction of sin might, in some, produce this effect, <lb/>who does

                    might find some land to <lb/>suit our purpose, within his district. He advised

                    landdrost</rs> being a great lover of music, I did not want much <lb/>entreaty to
                    play for him many of <persName>Haydn</persName>’s and

                    When the company had retired, we <lb/>took a walk to see the new church now
                    building, after a design of <lb/><rs type="person"><persName>Mr. Petersen</persName>, the Government
                        Surveyor</rs>. The outer walls and roof <lb/>were finished. It will be

                    fifteen hundred people, but <lb/>without a steeple, on account of the high
                    winds, or rather, the low <lb/>state of the town-purse. The clergyman’s house
                    will be placed on<lb/> one, and the school on the other side of the church,

                    taken out, so <lb/>as to form a spacious room, holding about two hundred

                <p><lb/>In the morning, the whole country was enveloped in a thick fog, <lb/>but it

                    to about sixty <lb/>hearers. It was a dry discussion of doctrinal points, with
                    an attempt, <lb/>in the usual way, to prove the doctrine of particular election
                    and <lb/>reprobation, which tended but little to edification. The reader,
                    <lb/>however, concluded with an extempore prayer, in a strain of humility
                    <lb/>and true christian charity, which seemed to proceed from his heart. <lb/>We
                    regretted, therefore, the more, that he was not left to preach the <lb/>doctrine
                    of salvation by faith in the merits of Jesus Christ, the Sa<lb break="no"/>viour
                    of all repenting sinners, but obliged to unfurl the banner of a <lb/>party, in
                    reading a controversial discourse. The concluding hymn <lb/>was accompanied on
                    an organ, much out of tune. After service, <lb/>we took a walk in the garden,
                    and on our return, ascending the foot <lb/>of the mountain in the waggon,
                    visited the woods on its declivity, <lb/>admiring the luxuriant growth of many
                    large timber-trees.</p>

                    atmosphere became remarkably clear. We were extremely <lb/>delighted with the
                    beautiful woods and glens, upon which we soon <lb/>entered, and pronounced the
                    environs of <placeName role="visited">George</placeName>, flat as its own
                    <lb/>situation appears, to be as interesting and romantic, as any part <lb/>of
                    the country we had yet seen. In about an hour’s time, passing <lb/>by the farm
                    to which our oxen belonged, they all on a sudden <lb/> turned short round,
                    preferring to graze at their own quarters, <lb/>rather than to toil through the
                    defiles before us. It was with some <lb/>difficulty that they were made to
                    proceed.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our road lay in a line nearly parallel to the high range of moun<lb

                    several pleasant and well-wooded vales, we reached <lb/><placeName

                    it by <rs type="person">the <lb/>landdrost</rs>, by no means exaggerated. The view
                    of the glen is <lb/>both magnificent and terrific. On leaving the waggons to
                    walk <lb/>down the steep, we began to fear for their safety, and our appre<lb
                        break="no"/>hensions were not lessened by listening to stories, told on the
                    road <lb/>by the Hottentots, of misfortunes experienced by travellers, whose
                    <lb/>waggons were broken, and their cattle killed in the descent, es<lb
                        break="no"/>pecially in stormy weather. At first, the road slopes down
                        gra<lb break="no"/>dually through a thicket, with larger trees interspersed.
                    A deep <lb/>ravine to the right receives the brook <placeName role="visited"
                        >Zwart Revier</placeName>, the same <lb/>which passes by <rs type="place" role="mentioned">the drosty at <placeName

                    great <lb/>roaring of hidden waters, and adds much to the grandeur of the
                    <lb/>scene. It is not so much its steepness, which renders the pas<lb break="no"

                    the extreme unevenness <lb/>of the road, if road that may be called, where, as
                    yet, art has not <lb/>assisted nature, and the traveller must pass over rocks,
                    in steps of <lb/>from one to two feet perpendicular height, the waggons bouncing
                    <lb/>down, reeling from side to side, and but for the management of Hot<lb

                    and <lb/>the poor beasts staggering before them, would be precipitated into
                    <lb/>the abyss beneath. Long before we had reached the bottom of the <lb/>glen,
                    we were convinced, that our own oxen would not have been <lb/>able to perform
                    this service. The poor animals seemed often quite <lb/>confused; the shaft-oxen
                    being almost thrown down, the waggon <lb/>nearly falling upon them, and the rest
                    of the spann sometimes <lb/>hurried forward to draw, and then again kept back to
                    prevent <lb/>mischief. It being ebb-tide, we passed the <placeName
                        role="visited">Kayman’s Revier</placeName>, <lb/>which flows through the
                    glen into the <placeName role="mentioned"> Indian ocean</placeName>, without
                        diffi<lb break="no"/>culty, and gave a few moments’ rest to our frightened
                    cattle, upon <lb/>whose strength we were going to draw still more largely, to
                    work <lb/>our waggons up the rocky acclivities of the eastern bank. The
                    <lb/>view of the glen from below is majestic. The steeps on both sides <lb/>are
                    clothed with a noble forest. Strata of red rock, shelving down <lb/>the western
                    bank, form a singular contrast with the lively green of <lb/>the bushes on the
                    slopes between them. A deep chasm or rent re<lb break="no"/>ceiving the
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Zwart Revier</placeName>, as above described,
                    divides the bank, and <lb/>forms <placeName role="visited">the Gat, or

                    water-fall glistens, by the admission of some faint light from <lb/>above. It is
                    said, that formerly crocodiles were found here in great <lb/>numbers, making
                    this chasm their chief place of resort. But they <lb/>have long since withdrawn,
                    and left to man full possession. Now <lb/>and then, a leguan is seen, and the
                    woods and glens afford pretty <lb/>safe haunts for various descriptions of wild
                    beasts. Several glens <lb/>meet here, all filled with wood, through which
                    mountain-torrents <lb/>swell the revier. It must be crossed at low water, by

                <p><lb/>The eastern bank was, if possible, more steep and rugged in its <lb/>ascent
                    than the western. The baggage-waggon took the lead, but <lb/>having laboured
                    hard for about two hundred paces, the oxen refused <lb/>to stir another step. No
                    shouts of the drivers, cracking of whips, <lb/>or hard blows, would make the

                    <lb/>but when further urged, they turned sharp round, and threw the <lb/>whole
                    spann into such confusion, that there was some danger of the <lb/>waggon rolling
                    down and dragging the shaft-oxen backwards. It <lb/>was therefore necessary to
                    bring up twelve of the second spann to <lb/>their assistance, and after a long
                    time spent in unyoking the former, <lb/>placing them again in order, and adding
                    the latter, it afforded a <lb/>singular sight to see twenty-six oxen, with all

                    the road consisted; <lb/>every five minutes resting to take breath. After the
                    heavy waggon <lb/>had reached the summit, both spanns were sent down to fetch
                    <lb/>up the travelling waggon, which, being lighter, was more easily
                    <lb/>accomplished.</p>
                <p><lb/>It is impossible to describe all the romantic glens and singular

                <p><lb/>The farmer, notwithstanding the excessive fatigue his cattle had
                    <lb/>suffered, after short rest determined to proceed, without an out<lb

                    Kraal</placeName>, as proposed. Our road lay now through <lb/>a thick wood, in
                    which many a mighty tree seems to have yielded <lb/>to the axe. Bushrope, or
                    Bavianstau, a species of creeper resem<lb break="no"/>bling a rope, grows here
                    in abundance, and nearly envelopes some <lb/>of the loftiest trees, to the
                    destruction of their growth and beauty. <lb/>In the woods, a number of
                    Hottentots and slaves were busily em<lb break="no"/>ployed in sawing, and
                    preparing planks, beams, and shingles. In <lb/>about an hour, we arrived at

                    <lb/>justly dreaded by travellers. The descent from the west, though <lb/>rugged
                    and steep, is not attended with more difficulty than many <lb/>others in this
                    mountainous country. The view towards the mass <lb/>of hills to the north, is
                    remarkably grand and beautiful.</p>
                <p><lb/>On these occasions, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> always attended the

                    <lb/>under some horizontal strata of overhanging rock, crowned with
                    <lb/>beautiful trees and shrubs, we beheld the eastern bank with some
                    <lb/>degree of dismay. The road ascended with a steepness, which <lb/>seemed to
                    baffle the attempt of any beasts to draw up the lightest <lb/>weight. The
                    travelling-waggon, however, reached the top after <lb/>great exertion, but the
                    other required both spanns to be yoked to <lb/>it. The poor exhausted oxen made
                    more objections to put forth <lb/>their remaining strength at this place, than
                    at <placeName role="mentioned">Kayman’s Gat</placeName>, <lb/>and shouts and
                    lashes seemed to have lost their effect. They <lb/>turned round, entangled
                    themselves with the tackle, and more <lb/>than once, ten or twelve of them were
                    obliged to be unyoked, to <lb/>bring them again into order. We were above an
                    hour working <lb/>the waggon up the cliffs.</p>
                <p><lb/>This afforded time for some examination of the stone of which <lb/>the
                    mountain is formed. Towards the bottom of the defile, <lb/>huge blocks of
                    granite lie dispersed upon the surface, but higher <lb/>up, the chief stone is
                    sand-stone, with iron and quartz, as usual. <lb/>The granite is beautiful, with
                    a great quantity of bright, silver<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>coloured
                    mica, in large flakes, and in some instances chrystalized. <lb/>The feldspath
                    and quartz are much decomposed. Iron has inserted <lb/>itself, and seems to be
                    the cause both of speedy decomposition, and <lb/>of the division of some of the
                    blocks into irregular strata. When <lb/>protected within the bowels of the
                    earth, this species of granite may <lb/>be of a more durable quality, and some
                    of the larger blocks at the <lb/>bottom of the glen were so hard, that my hammer
                    and cold chissels <lb/>made but little impression upon them. Of what the strata
                    of rocks <lb/>beyond the pool might consist, I was not able to discover, their

                <p><lb/>After sunset, we closed the adventurous business of the day, and

                    <lb/>we were soon provided with a good supper, being our only meal <lb/>on this

                    The ford over the river <lb/>used to be at this place, where often the water was

                <p><lb/>The relay-oxen provided for us, being on this side, were obliged <lb/>to

                    from the summit of which one of the finest views we had yet <lb/>seen,
                    presented itself before us, with a well-wooded fore-ground of <lb/>hill and
                    dale, forming very picturesque scenery. The descent was <lb/>rough, through deep
                    sand, mixed with large stones, which rendered <lb/>the jolting of the waggon
                    insupportable to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName>, who, <lb/>preferred
                    walking down the hill through the wood, though the <lb/>pain in her head

                <p><lb/>Two of our party were now rendered invalids. Yesterday was a <lb/>day, when

                <p><lb/>The immense forests of <placeName role="visited">Plettenberg Bay</placeName>
                    are not without in<lb break="no"/>habitants. Elephants, buffaloes, tygers,
                    wolves, and wild boars, <lb/>having little to dread from that grand destroyer,
                    Man, find here <lb/>shelter. They seem all to have chosen their ground, some
                        prefer<lb break="no"/>ring the coast, and others the mountains. Thus, if not
                    followed <lb/>into their haunts, they are not often seen by the traveller,
                        espe<lb break="no"/>cially during the day, and we were never amused by the
                    gambols <lb/>of tygers or leopards, near the road. A few partridges were put
                    <lb/>up by <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>’s dog, and one or two of them
                    shot; but <lb/>passing through these woods, nothing is heard of that cheerful
                    <lb/>chirping and singing of birds, that busy hum of flying insects, <lb/>with
                    other symptoms of animated nature, which delight and in<lb break="no"/>spirit

                <p><lb/>We crossed several brooks, running, all but one, from the moun<lb break="no"

                        role="visited">Samson’s <lb/>Revier</placeName>, and taking its rise on some
                    high land near the coast, <lb/>runs rapidly towards the hills, where it is taken
                    up by the <placeName role="visited_nearby">Kier<lb break="no"/>booms
                        Revier</placeName>, and turned back. Its waters were remarkably <lb/>clear
                    and sweet, and whether from this cause, or feeling some in<lb break="no"/>terest
                    in its capricious course and opposition to general rule, we <lb/>here
                    replenished our stock of fresh water. On the banks of one <lb/>of the
                    abovementioned brooks, we found the larger species of <lb/>bukku, one of the
                    most aromatic, medicinal plants in the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and justly
                    esteemed for its healing properties. Its leaves <lb/>steeped in brandy or
                    vinegar, and the bottle placed in the heat <lb/>of the sun, emit an unctious
                    juice, by which the fluid is rendered <lb/>as thick as honey, and applied
                    particularly for the healing of <lb/>contusions, sores, and all external
                    complaints. The Hottentots <lb/>also use it for inward hurts, by mixing a
                    spoonful of it with warm <lb/>water. Its leaves are lancet-shaped and
                    serrated.</p>

                    <lb/>clouds, covering the western horizon, were fast following us, thun<lb
                        break="no"/>der muttering at a distance. In a short time, a violent wind
                    arose, <lb/>which filled the air with clouds of dust. The backs of the oxen
                    <lb/>and the waggons were covered with it. Soon after, it began to <lb/>lighten,
                    thunder, and rain, and almost made us fear, that we should <lb/>be obliged to
                    give up the thoughts of visiting <placeName role="visited">Jackal’s
                        Kraal</placeName> to<lb break="no"/>day, and be forced to seek shelter. We
                    persevered, however, and <lb/>by the time we had reached the heights, which
                    overlook the vale <lb/>bearing this name, the rain ceased. The sudden change in
                    the <lb/>appearance of the country afforded us much pleasure. From <lb/>an
                    insipid flat, it swelled into hills, with woody glens sloping <lb/>down towards
                    the vale. As it was now too late to examine the <lb/>spot proposed for an
                    establishment, a consultation was held; <lb/>the result of which was, that we
                    would not proceed to the next <lb/>farm, but, to save time, descend with our
                    waggons into the vale, <lb/>and there encamp for the night, though the weather
                    threatened <lb/>to be rather boisterous, and the appearance of the situation
                        be<lb break="no"/>low was wild, resembling a haunt of beasts of prey in

                    took <lb/>leave of our worthy and generous conductor. <rs type="person">The Veldcornet,
                        <lb/><persName>Mr. Van Huysteyn</persName></rs>, accompanied us into the valley.</p>

                    <lb/>But <persName>Mr. Rex</persName> generously declared, that he not only

                        Kraal</placeName>, where he had intended only to <lb/>put up a small

                    hopes of seeing the land cultivated, <lb/>and a settlement of Christian
                    Hottentots formed in his neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood. This declaration was now
                    solemnly repeated, and made <lb/>us determine to examine the situation, with a
                    view to a missionary <lb/>establishment.</p>
                <p><lb/>The descent into the vale was not too steep, but finding no <lb/>path, we
                    pulled through the long grass and bushes, over stony or <lb/>marshy ground, with
                    some difficulty and uncertainty, till having <lb/>reached a spot near a grove of
                    tall trees, rising out of thick under<lb break="no"/>wood, we pitched our tent
                    on a dry place, surrounded with high <lb/>bushes, which served us for fuel. Here
                    we made two large fires, <lb/>both for culinary purposes, and to frighten away
                    any wild beasts <lb/>which might be disposed to visit us during the night, this
                    place <lb/>having been reported to be the haunt of a great number of fero<lb
                        break="no"/>cious animals. But, as usually is the case, the love of
                    frightful <lb/>tales had probably created monsters in the reporter’s imagina<lb

                    <lb/>their presence, and our cattle walked about the bushes, picking <lb/>their
                    food, without molestation. Yet as caution was necessary in <lb/>a place unknown,
                    and to appearance admirably suited to be a <lb/>dwelling-place for wild
                    creatures, we men went in a body, while it <lb/>was yet light, to view the spot

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-03-23">23d.</date> We commenced our survey, according
                    to a plan agreed on <lb/>last night. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> and
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456933">Stein</persName> went with me to <rs type="place" role="visited">cap<lb

                    narrow kloof <lb/>out of which the rivulet flows. On leaving the kloof, it
                    buries it<lb break="no"/>self under an assemblage of stones, from which, at
                    about an hun<lb break="no"/>dred yards distance, it emerges in sufficient force,
                    even in this dry <lb/>season, to supply a mill. A broad path, made by
                    wood-cutters, <lb/>afforded a convenient passage into the kloof. The eastern sun
                    <lb/>shone with great brightness into it, gilding the banks on both sides.
                    <lb/>They rise steep to a considerable height, and are clothed with a
                    <lb/>romantic wood of every species of tree growing in the country, in<lb
                        break="no"/>numerable flowering plants and shrubs covering the ground. Here
                    <lb/>and there, masses of rock peep through the surrounding foliage. <lb/>The
                    rivulet rushes rapidly through the shady grove, over a stony <lb/>bed, and we
                    followed its course to a place where it forms a deep <lb/>pool under a
                    perpendicular rock. From the accidental position <lb/>of the broken fragments of
                    stone, piled up in order at its foot, <lb/>this rock might, at some distance, be
                    taken for a mass of basaltes. <lb/>The water filled the whole space, and obliged
                    us to ascend the hill. <lb/>Having, however, satisfied ourselves as to the
                    supply of water to be <lb/>gained from the rivulet, we returned to the tent,
                    much pleased <lb/>with the discoveries we had made. We made a favourable report
                    <lb/>of them at an excellent breakfast, for which, through <persName>Mr.

                    the hills by torrents. Some of it was flaky, full of larger <lb/>or smaller
                    cavities, filled with fine yellow ochre. Sand-stone and <lb/>quartz lie, as

                    rendered picturesque by ledg es <lb/>of grey rock, with intermediate bushes. We
                    were informed, that <lb/>they swarm with apes and baboons, as likewise with
                    tygers, wolves, <lb/>and other wild animals; and though the latter seldom
                    approach the <lb/>dwellings, yet the cries of the poor antelopes and other game,
                    seized <lb/>and worried by them among the rocks and woods, are frequently
                    <lb/>heard below. <persName>Mr. P.</persName> walked with us into the garden,

                    The bird was not much <lb/>intimidated, for he alighted at a short distance,

                    rugged out-line, with many peaks. Before them are ranges <lb/>of lower hills, of
                    which, from one point, we counted no less than five, <lb/>running parallel to
                    each other, and intersected vertically by num<lb break="no"/>berless kloofs,
                    likewise in parallel lines, so as to give to the whole <lb/>the appearance of
                    division by art. These kloofs are partly naked, <lb/>partly filled with bushes,
                    or lined on each side with rocks. To the <lb/>right of the road, the slope of
                    the hill, sinking into a deep glen <lb/>beneath, grew more and more steep, as we
                    proceeded, and in some <lb/>places to that degree, that we began to give credit
                    to the stories <lb/>of waggons and oxen rolling down altogether, and being seen
                    no <lb/>more. A misfortune of this kind is said to have happened to a
                    <lb/>waggon in <persName>General Dundas</persName>’s retinue, when going over
                    the <placeName role="mentioned">Dui<lb break="no"/>vilskop</placeName>.</p>
                <p><lb/>In about two hours, we reached the <placeName role="visited">Paerdekop
                        (Horse’s Head) <lb/>mountain</placeName>, over the very summit of which we
                    had to pass. Its <lb/>steepness in all directions renders it impossible to carry
                    the road <lb/>round its sides. Our exhausted oxen were hardly able to drag
                    <lb/>the waggons along, and we were obliged again to have recourse to <lb/>a
                    double spann. The sand-stone rock, forming the mass of the <lb/>mountain,
                    appears lying in strata nearly perpendicular, besides <lb/>which, a vast number
                    of large loose fragments are strewed upon its <lb/>surface. Many of them are
                    clothed with a lichen of a bright Ver<lb break="no"/>million colour. Quartz lies
                    in veins, or in detached pieces. The <lb/>soil produces a variety of bushes,
                    flowering shrubs and aloes, be<lb break="no"/>tween the stones. With the help of
                    our men, bearing the waggon <lb/>up on either side, as the slope of the road
                    required, and suffering <lb/>our cattle to rest every two or three minutes, we
                    at length sur<lb break="no"/>mounted every difficulty, and got safely across
                    this dreaded mountain, <lb/>to an out-spann place in a dreary wilderness. After
                    an hour’s rest, <lb/>we set out again, and our groom,
                        <persName>Leonhard</persName>, having pointed out a <lb/>footpath, by which

                    time with great zeal, in repeating the experiment.</p>
                <p><lb/>Meeting an old grey-headed Hottentot, with a long beard, dress<lb break="no"
                    />ed only in a kaross and skin apron, we entered into conversation <lb/>with him
                    I presented him with a few doppelgens (penny pieces). <lb/>He thanked me, and
                    observed, that of all things in the world he <lb/>loved money best.
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> asked him, whether he did not <lb/>love
                    God better, to which he replied, that he knew nothing of him. <lb/>This gave the
                    missionary an opportunity of declaring to him the <lb/>love of God to man, and
                    to direct the poor old man to Jesus, who <lb/>had loved him unto death, and
                    deserved to be loved above every <lb/>thing inearth and heaven. The Hottentot
                    listened with attention <lb/>and surprise, and promised to think on that which
                    he had now <lb/>heard, and pray to God to give him grace to understand it.</p>
                <p><lb/>After a tedious and troublesome walk, we arrived at a kraal, near <lb/>a
                    valley, where an aged Hottentot lived, with two slaves. The <lb/>kraal consisted
                    of a circular building of reeds and rushes, covered <lb/>with grass, a garden
                    near the brook, and a small enclosure for cattle. <lb/>Two shaggy dogs announced
                    our arrival with loud barking, which <lb/>brought out the old man, accompanied,
                    to our comfort, by <persName>Leon<lb break="no"/>hard</persName>, who had
                    reached the place before us, and turned our horses <lb/>into the field to graze.
                    The man seemed much pleased with our <lb/>visit, and not well fitted for a
                    hermit. On leaving him, we descend<lb break="no"/>ed into the valley, crossed
                    the brook, and mounted a steep hill, <lb/>from which, in a short time, we
                    discovered our waggons coming <lb/>down the woody glen. They followed us up the
                    hill, which proved <lb/>one of the longest ascents, and heaviest roads in the
                    whole journey. <lb/>Here I found the first chrystals of quartz, diminutive
                    indeed, but <lb/>clear, in veins and fissures of sand-stone, and, in general,
                    more dis<lb break="no"/>position to chrystallization in the quartz, than I had
                    ever met with <lb/>before in this country. Had we foot-passengers not got so far
                    <lb/>forward up the hill, before the waggons arrived at the bottom, it <lb/>was
                    the boor’s intention to have spent the night in the valley.</p>

                    <lb/>and arrived long after sunset, at a place called <placeName role="visited"
                        >Kloetes Kraal</placeName>. <lb/>Here was neither house, nor Hottentot’s

                    <lb/>mattrass could be got ready, lay down in the waggon to rest. <lb/>While
                    supper was cooking, which for some days was our only <lb/>meal, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister

                    and <lb/>unsolicited services of my South African brethren and friends,

                    <lb/>remain deeply impressed upon my heart.</p>
                <p><lb/>The situation of our encampment was dreary in the extreme, <lb/>high and
                    bleak, surrounded with low eminences, which shut out <lb/>the view of the
                    mountains, not a tree in sight, and far distant from <lb/>the dwellings of men.
                    During the night, which was very dark, I <lb/>was roused from sleep, by
                    perceiving some odd motion of the <lb/>waggon. I sat up, and for a moment felt
                    afraid, that some wild <lb/>beast had approached our camp, when one of the
                    wheels seemed <lb/>fairly lifted off the ground by some external force. Being so
                    closely <lb/>shut in, that I could not discover the cause, I called to the
                        Hotten<lb break="no"/>tots, who were sleeping round the fire, to come to my
                    assistance, <lb/>and my shouts alarmed the whole party. It was soon found, that
                    <lb/>the innocent author of this disturbance was one of our horses, who,
                    <lb/>having returned trom the place, where he had been sent to feed, was
                    <lb/>amusing himself by scrubbing his back against the wheel. He was, <lb/>of
                    course, driven away, but soon returned to my great annoyance, <lb/>till my
                    patience being exhausted, I got up, and sent him off to some <lb/>distance.

                <p><lb/>We now found that our sociable friend from the round kraal <lb/>had followed

                    He had thus gained a good deal of amuse<lb break="no"/>ment, and, we hope, some
                    useful information and instruction, be<lb break="no"/>sides partaking of their
                    supper and breakfast. We were at least <lb/>six miles from his hermitage, and

                    <lb/>plants, unknown to our best botanist, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>. In
                    some <lb/>places, the rugged sides of the hills are clothed with aloes, and
                    <lb/>other larger plants, and as we proceeded, we saw, on many hills, <lb/>the
                    so-called Wageboom growing dispersed, resembling a planted <lb/>orchard, the
                    trees standing fifteen or twenty paces asunder. Of <lb/>wild creatures, we saw
                    only a few rehbock antelopes, but being <lb/>excessively shy, our huntsmen
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Schmitt</persName> and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Melville</persName> rode or ran
                    <lb/>after them in vain. Elephants, wild boars, wolves, and tygers, <lb/>as
                    likewise baboons, haunt these desolate regions, the first how<lb break="no"
                    />ever, only where they find wood and water.</p>
                <p><lb/>One of our young drivers related to his companion, that at the <lb/>round
                    kraal, which we visited yesterday, he watched a tyger for <lb/>several nights
                    successively, climbing up the poles of the hen-roost. <lb/>This is a platform
                    made of branches of trees covered with bushes <lb/>or grass, supported by four
                    or more uprights, about ten or twelve <lb/>feet high, to which the cocks and
                    hens fly, about sunset, and <lb/>there roost during the night, out of the reach
                    of mausehunde, foxes, <lb/>and other destructive animals. Nor can tygers, or
                    wild cats, well <lb/>scramble up a smooth pole, with an overhanging
                    superstructure. <lb/>The tyger had succeeded in siezing one or two chickens,
                    near the <lb/>edge of the roost, and the Hottentot was determined to stop his
                    <lb/>thieving. He made two small holes in the side of the kraal, one <lb/>for
                    the muzzle of his gun, the other for his eye, behind which he <lb/>lay in
                    ambush. The tyger soon came, and clasping one of the <lb/>poles with his claws,
                    seemed contriving how best to mount to the <lb/>platform. At that moment the lad
                    fired, and the animal fell, but <lb/>uttered so loud a roar, that, thinking him
                    yet alive, and likely in <lb/>his fury, to make an attack upon the kraal, he
                    first let out his dog. <lb/>The dog soon put an end to the tyger’s life, as he
                    had received the <lb/>shot through his body.</p>
                <p><lb/>About <date when-iso="1816-03-25T17:00">five o’clock</date>, we arrived at <placeName role="visited">Klip

                    to the Veldcornets were <lb/>given, under the supposition, that we should cross

                    did not meet with relays on this road. We thus lost more in <lb/>time, than we
                    gained in distance. Having pitched our tent in the <lb/>field near the house,
                    and given our host a good supper, we enjoyed <lb/>a comfortable night’s
                    rest.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-03-26">26th.</date> We breakfasted in the house with
                    the family, and had the <lb/>pleasure of treating them with a dish of genuine
                    and well-made <lb/>coffee. They are poor, and have many children, whom they find
                    <lb/>it difficult to maintain. Wherever we found this to be the case, <lb/>far
                    from wishing to lessen their stock of provisions, by our requi<lb break="no"
                    />sitions, we gave them what we could afford, out of the supplies <lb/>we had
                    brought with us, or purchased from richer boors. But <lb/>though they were poor,
                        <persName>Mr</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Barkhuis</persName> treated us in

                    tasted, <lb/>since we left <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>.
                    Some friends of our host were here, <lb/>and dined with us. Their conversation
                    turned upon that never<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>failing subject of
                    complaint against the English Government, the <lb/>new taxes, and the measuring
                    and valuing of the lands.</p>
                <p><lb/>About <date when-iso="1816-03-26T14:00">two o’clock</date>, we left <placeName role="visited">Klip

                    host, where we ex<lb break="no"/>pected to procure relays. The road was very
                    uneven, in many <lb/>places steep and rocky, and having our host’s son, a huge
                    lad of <lb/>seventeen, for our driver, his giddiness and inattention caused us
                    <lb/>considerable alarm. In about three hours, we arrived at the above<lb
                        break="no" type="hyphenated"/>mentioned place, where we not only found no

                    extraordinary bulk, and determined coun<lb break="no"/>tenance, occupied one
                    corner of the room, and not a smile or inviting <lb/>word bid us welcome. After
                    staring some time at one another, the <lb/>usual laconic address was uttered;
                    “Sit” was the word, and we <pb n="177"/>

                    we were expected to sup with the family, but no invitation <lb/>being given, we
                    thought best to bid them good night, and retreat <lb/>into our tent.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-03-27">27th.</date> We were amused this morning by all

                    dragoon, as to his hav<lb break="no"/>ing seen a packet of letters from
                        <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName> at <rs type="place"
                        role="mentioned"><rs type="person">the Veldcornet</rs>’s house</rs>,
                    <lb/>addressed to me. It seemed almost incredible, but, to my very <lb/>great
                    satisfaction, proved a true tale, for the packet was delivered <lb/>to me in the
                    afternoon by a dragoon. It contained letters from my <lb/>family of
                        <date when-iso="1815-11">November</date>, and <date when-iso="1815-12">December</date>, and from friends in

                    to me by the kindness of <persName>Mr. Van Ker<lb break="no"/>vel</persName>.
                    The receipt of this welcome present, in this dreary region, <lb/>contributed
                    much to lessen the regret we felt at meeting again <lb/>with so unpleasant a
                    detention. We had sent a boy on horseback <lb/>to <rs type="person">the
                        Veldcornet</rs>, to obtain information respecting the relays, <lb/>in
                    consequence of which, that gentleman arrived in the after<lb break="no"/>noon.
                    He had provided the necessary relays, but having order<lb break="no"/>ed them,
                    some days ago, on the road towards the <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Duivelskop</placeName>, <lb/>they were now countermanded, and directed
                    hither. Meanwhile <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName> had got into favour
                    with the old lady and her <lb/>daughters, who now insisted upon taking our meals
                    with them. <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> and I were employed during the
                    day in drawing and <lb/>writing, and some of us took a walk into the rocky glen,
                    out of <lb/>which the <placeName role="visited_nearby">Kierbooms

                    appear in strata of considerable breadth, with bushes <lb/>interspersed. They
                    are of sand-stone, coloured by iron, with <lb/>much quartz. But the most

                    exhibiting, as it were, a huge bank, <lb/>with an even ridge, divided downwards
                    in parallel lines, by nar<lb break="no"/>row kloofs. At the bottom of each kloof
                    lies a round hillock, <lb/>formed, to all appearance, by earth and stones washed

                    <lb/>easily explained than some others; but what with their barrenness <lb/>and

                <p><lb/>In the evening, <persName>Mrs. Barkhuis</persName> proposed that

                    <lb/>should deliver a discourse to the family, the Hottentots and slaves <lb/>in
                    her service being admitted. This was done; about thirty per<lb break="no"/>sons
                    were present, and we hope that the Lord, who has promised, <lb/>that His “word
                    shall not return void, but accomplish the thing <lb/>whereunto it is sent,” will
                    have caused some of the seed sown, to <lb/>have fallen into ground prepared by
                    His Spirit to receive it, <lb/>so as to bring forth fruit. The Hottentots and
                    slaves were parti<lb break="no"/>cularly attentive, and expressed afterwards
                    their thanks to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother <lb/>Schmitt</persName>, and their earnest
                    wish, that, in this neighbourhood, a <lb/>settlement might be formed, where they
                    might hear the word of <lb/>God. From our own Hottentots they heard much of
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>, <lb/>and of the benefits
                    enjoyed by their countrymen living in our set<lb break="no"/>tlements, and, no

                        role="visited">Lange Kloof</placeName>, properly so <lb/>called, being a
                    vale of perhaps a hundred miles in length, enclosed <lb/>by mountains of
                    different heights. On entering upon it, we felt <lb/>not a little disappointed.
                    We were no longer amused with a mag<lb break="no"/>nificent show of peaks,
                    table-mountains, or round tops in succession, <lb/>but saw a long ridge of

                    On one of the hills we descried a com<lb break="no"/>pany of baboons. They first
                    seemed to wait our approach, but soon <lb/>retreated in haste towards the

                    <lb/>then a charming prospect opened. After about an hour’s ride, <lb/>we saw
                    waggons and horsemen coming to meet us. They were a <lb/>transport of Hottentot
                    soldiers with some dragoons, returning <lb/>from the interior. Among the former,
                    two or three belonged to <lb/>our people, and had some conversation with

                        <persName type="group">The Fereira</persName>’s are of Portuguese origin.
                    His great grand<lb break="no"/>father (or one above him, I forget which) was the
                    only person <lb/>saved from a Portuguese ship, which foundered at sea, off
                        <placeName role="mentioned">the <lb/>Cape</placeName>. He got upon a plank,
                    which supported him for three days, <lb/>and rowing with his hands in a
                    direction, in which he expected to <lb/>find land, by God’s mercy, he succeeded,
                    and reached <placeName role="mentioned">the Cape</placeName>
                    <lb/>shore, though nearly exhausted, and perishing with hunger. <lb/>Here, by
                    industry, he and his successors raised themselves into <lb/>creditable
                    situations. Of his father, a singular instance of cou<lb break="no"/>rage and
                    good fortune is told. A large tyger, having long in<lb break="no"/>fested his
                    premises and the neighbourhood, and killed many <lb/>sheep, belonging to him and
                    other boors; a party assembled to <lb/>endeavour to destroy the monster. His
                    haunt being discovered, <lb/><persName>Mr. Fereira</persName> was foremost in
                    the attack, when the tyger instantly <lb/>made a spring at him, as he sat on
                    horseback, the rest of the <lb/>party not having come up, and only one slave
                    being with him. <lb/>The horse taking fright, ran off with his rider, who was
                    but slightly <lb/>wounded. The tyger was meanwhile attacked by all the dogs,
                    <lb/>and a furious contest ensued. <persName>Mr. Fereira</persName>, not
                    intimidated, as <lb/>soon as he could again command his horse, returned to the
                    charge, <lb/>and encouraged the dogs by the usual cry of Zaza, Zaza. The
                    <lb/>enraged animal, hearing this cry, quitted the dogs, and flew a se<lb
                        break="no"/>cond time at <persName>Mr. Fereira</persName>’s head, when with
                    one gripe he tore off <lb/>his scalp, and threw him upon the ground, where he
                    was pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding, with teeth and claws, to put an end to his
                    existence. <lb/>The faithful slave, seeing his master in such imminent danger,
                    <lb/>ran to his assistance, and attempted to stab the tyger with a knife.
                    <lb/>The infuriated beast, however, was too quick for him, seized his <lb/>hand
                    with his teeth, and flung him upon his master, doing his best <lb/>to kill them
                    both, which, by his strength and swiftness of motion, <lb/>he probably would
                    have accomplished, had not the other huntsmen, <pb n="181"/>

                <p><lb/>The weather in the afternoon had turned out rather unfavour<lb break="no"
                    />able, and we expected a rainy, windy night, yet every now and <lb/>then, the
                    stars appeared, and while we were amused by a sudden <lb/>flash of light, not
                    much inferior in brightness to what is called <lb/>white lightning, occasioned
                    by a shooting star, all on a sudden, a <lb/>crash was heard, and the
                    baggage-waggon being foremost, and con<lb break="no"/>spicuous by its white
                    covering, vanished out of sight. The careless <lb/>leader, a Hottentot lad, had
                    suffered the oxen to turn upon the <lb/>grassy bank, which on each side, by
                    degrees, rose to the height of <lb/>two feet above the level of the road. On
                    turning in again, both <lb/>wheels slipping of the edge of the bank at once, the
                    waggon im<lb break="no"/>mediately overset, and fell into the hollow, with its
                    top downwards, <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456933">Brother Stein</persName> was lying in it, fast
                    asleep. We instantly quitted <lb/>our waggon to come to his assistance. To our
                    great sorrow, we <lb/>found him much hurt, both in his head and right arm,
                    particularly <lb/>in the latter. He felt faint, and stunned with the blow. Our
                    first <lb/>business, therefore, was to do all in our power to afford him relief.
                    <lb/>The oxen were unyoked, the tent set up, and a fire kindled with <lb/>some
                    bushes, which our Hottentots, contrary to their usual custom, <lb/>had gathered,
                    and tied behind the waggon. It was well, that, for <lb/>once, they had been so
                    provident, for the place, where the over<lb break="no"/>throw happened, was
                    quite destitute of bushes or any kind of fuel.</p>
                <p><lb/>The night was so dark, that we could not see far around us, <lb/>but only
                    perceived, that we were in a valley between low, barren <lb/>eminences, with a
                    flat top. With a view to discover whether <lb/>there were any bushes in the
                    neighbourhood, we set the dry grass <lb/>and rushes on fire. The fire ran along
                    so fast, that I began to be <lb/>apprehensive, that in case we were near any
                    dwellings, or Hotten<lb break="no"/>tot huts, mischief might ensue, and with
                    much trouble we extin<lb break="no"/>guished it again, but not before it had

                    had <lb/>been the cause of it. He was not able to lift his arm, but did not
                    <lb/>think that it was fractured, and, as none of us possessed the least
                    <lb/>skill in surgical affairs, we were obliged to leave him to apply what
                    <lb/>he thought best. The bottle of bukku brandy was not broken, <lb/>and this
                    was the only medicine he used, from first to last.</p>
                <p><lb/>We now began to examine the waggon, when, to our great joy, <lb/>we found,
                    that it had not received the slightest injury by the fall. <lb/>That part of the
                    hollow road, into which it had fallen, was full of fine <lb/>sand, soft and
                    yielding, whereas, if it had overset about half a dozen <lb/>paces sooner, or as
                    many farther forward, it would have fallen upon <lb/>a bare rock, and probably
                    been greatly damaged. The mischief done <lb/>to the contents of the waggon, was
                    likewise not so great, as might <lb/>have been expected. A few cups, saucers,
                    and plates, were broken, <lb/>but we regretted most of all the total loss of our
                    stock of wild <lb/>honey, both jars being thrown out ot the waggon-chest, and
                    dashed <lb/>to pieces, and all their sweet contents spilt in the sand. After
                    <lb/>emptying the waggon, and setting all hands to work, we lifted it <lb/>up,
                    drew it forward upon even ground, and packed it again. Pro<lb break="no"

                    experienced a singular proof, in the manner in which <lb/>we met with this
                    accident, as above stated. One of the company <lb/>observed, that in every

                <p><lb/>During the night, not being disposed to sleep, I thought much <lb/>on our

                    <lb/>received, and whether, perhaps, our progress might not be inter<lb
                        break="no"/>rupted, if not our plans frustrated, by this circumstance.
                        When<lb break="no"/>ever I perceived him stirring on his mattrass, I asked
                    softly, how <lb/>he felt, and always received that comforting answer, that he
                    did <lb/>not think, that his arm was broken. He begged no alteration in <lb/>our
                    plan might be made on his account, and expressed his trust <lb/>in God, that no
                    further harm was done, than that he was for a time <lb/>disabled, and we should
                    miss his assistance on the journey. Mean<lb break="no"/>while we all waited
                    anxiously for the morning, and considered it as <lb/>very providential, that it

                    walked on to <rs type="place" role="mentioned"><persName>Mr. Mey</persName>’s farm,
                        <lb/>on <placeName role="mentioned">Kromm Revier</placeName></rs>,
                    where we had intended to spend the night, to <lb/>announce our arrival, and
                    procure the relays. <persName>Lebrecht Aris</persName> was <lb/>gone forward in
                    another direction, to order a second spann. The <lb/>Hottentots belonging to the
                    relays, were wandering about, on a vain <lb/>search for the strayed cattle, and
                    we were left alone with <persName>Johannes</persName>
                    <lb/>and <persName>Jeremias</persName>. We were therefore all obliged to assist
                    in yoking the <lb/>oxen, some of which did not seem to have much respect for
                    their <lb/>new masters, but ran about, or showed a threatening pair of
                    <lb/>horns. At length they were subdued, and having made up a <lb/>bed in the
                    baggage-waggon for our wounded companion, we pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded, and
                    reached the hill above <rs type="place" role="visited_nearby"><persName>Mr.
                            Mey</persName>’s farm</rs>. On inquiry, <lb/>we heard that
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> had sent <persName>Marcus</persName>
                    forward to a far<lb break="no"/>mer of the same name for a relay, and was
                    himself gone to <rs type="place" role="mentioned"><placeName role="mentioned">Ellands<lb break="no"/>fonteyn</placeName>, a
                        place belonging to <persName>Mr. Piet Fereira</persName></rs>.

                    <lb/>and I followed him, while <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> staid with the waggons. <lb/>We met
                    him returning, and though he had got no oxen, he was <lb/>well-pleased with his
                    visit. The farmer’s wife was anxiously con<lb break="no"/>cerned for the
                    salvation of her soul, and very eager to hear from <lb/>him, in what way she
                    might find rest. He showed her, from the <lb/>scriptures, that she could not
                    obtain it, but by coming to Jesus, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to His own gracious
                    invitation, given to “all that labour <lb/>and are heavily laden.” She seemed to
                    derive comfort from his <lb/>encouraging address. He recommended to her to read
                    the bible, <lb/>with prayer, that the Spirit of Truth might explain to her soul
                    <lb/>the word of the Cross, which is “the power of God unto salvation to
                    <lb/>every one that believeth.” He had also met with a man from the
                        <lb/><placeName role="mentioned">Chamtoos Revier</placeName>, who gave him
                    much useful information about <lb/>that country, and of its occupation by many

                        >Gnadenthal</placeName> had already made our errand known <lb/>among the

                    <lb/>informed <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName>, that he had a place exactly

                    <lb/>promised, that if we discovered nothing to suit us in <placeName

                <p><lb/>As we could not procure the oxen we wanted, we proceeded <lb/>with those we
                    had brought with us, to a valley, whither <persName>Mr. <lb/>Marcus</persName>
                    had ordered two spanns to meet us. Here we turned the <lb/>former adrift,
                    leaving them to find their way home, which they are <lb/>sure to do, though no
                    driver be with them. We were very thank<lb break="no"/>ful to <persName>Mr.
                        Marcus</persName> for his civility, especially as he had at first de<lb
                        break="no"/>clared, that he would not furnish any oxen, except by command of
                    <lb/>his own <rs type="person">Veldcornet</rs>.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our road lay through a narrow vale, with the <placeName role="visited">Kromm
                        Revier</placeName> running in a deep bottom. This river rises in a barren

                <p><lb/>Our next station was <rs type="place" role="visited"><placeName role="visited">Jagersbosch</placeName>, a farm belonging

                    <lb/>promised to send us forward in the morning. A tyger had just <lb/>been
                    killed by one of his Hottentots, and two dragoons were help<lb break="no"/>ing
                    him to skin the animal, the carcase being still warm. It was <lb/>a beautiful
                    young creature. The manner in which it was killed <lb/>deserves notice. The
                    Hottentot having discovered his haunt, went <lb/>out with ten dogs, but without
                    any other weapon than a club. As <lb/>soon as the animal perceived the dogs
                    advancing, he fixed his fiery <lb/>eyes upon the man, and flew towards him. The
                    Hottentot pre<lb break="no"/>sented his kaross as a shield, and succeeded in
                    warding off the <lb/>stroke and throwing the tyger upon his back, when the dogs,
                        in<lb break="no"/>stantly falling upon him, kept him down, till the
                    Hottentot had an <lb/>opportunity of hitting him some severe blows on the head
                    with his <lb/>club, by which he was stunned, and then stoned to death. The
                    <lb/>skin was not injured, and I promised the conqueror to purchase it <lb/>on
                    my return, if I found it well tanned.</p>

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-03-31">31st.</date> After breakfast, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother
                        Schmitt</persName> and I walked up to the <lb/>farm-house, and took a view
                    of the premises. The poor farmer <lb/>was so much alarmed at the expense of
                    measurement and taxation, <lb/>that he offered to dispose of his place at the
                    low price of twelve <lb/>hundred rix-dollars. It has many advantages, and water
                    in abun<lb break="no"/>dance, brought by a <hi rend="i">slote</hi>, or canal,
                    from a considerable distance, <lb/>and lying so high, that all the grounds may
                    be irrigated with ease, <lb/>and a mill supplied by it. The house was in ruins,
                    and one miser<lb break="no"/>able room contained the whole family. In the
                    grounds stood a re<lb break="no"/>markably large, wide-spreading oak, bamboos of
                    very stately growth, <lb/>and a great number of orange, lemon, peach, and other
                    fruit-trees, <lb/>but all neglected, and going to decay. In former days, the
                    place <lb/>was kept in good order, avenues of trees and hedges still remain<lb
                        break="no"/>ing. The lands, belonging to the farm, extend for a consider<lb
                        break="no"/>able way, both up and down the river, and appeared to us well
                    <lb/>adapted for the growth both of corn and grass. But there is an
                    <lb/>objection to this place for a missionary station, which, in our view,
                    <lb/>was an insuperable one. It lies on the high road; the inhabitant <lb/>is
                    continually annoyed by calls, and put to great expense by enter<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>traveller is often turned out, and sometimes prefers to encamp <lb/>upon
                    the werft, or in the field, yet every one thinks himself at <lb/>liberty to
                    enter any house on the road, and sit down to talk.</p>
                <p><lb/>The time, before <persName>Mr. Akkerman</persName>’s oxen arrived from the

                    the farm-house, and descend <lb/>into a woody glen, through which ran a clear
                    brook, falling in small <lb/>cascades down the rocky declivity, and altogether
                    appearing a <lb/>romantic retreat. The place first chosen for our tent being
                    <lb/>much exposed to the wind, we found another, more sheltered, and, <lb/>as
                    the oxen had been some time unyoked, and were gone away, <lb/>we performed, in
                    their place, the service of drawing the waggons <lb/>to it.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our tent was now pitched on a grassy spot, surrounded with <lb/>bushes, and
                    defended by high trees against the wind, which had <lb/>risen to a pretty heavy

                    <lb/>appearance as large as a mastiff, running out of one thicket into
                    <lb/>another, the light of the fire showing his shape pretty distinctly.
                    <lb/>Though she was laughed at for her fears, we all felt some degree <lb/>of
                    alarm, and rekindled our two fires, for we were in a region, where <lb/>wild
                    beasts were said to abound, and where cover enough was to <lb/>be found for them
                    among the rocks and bushes.</p>
                <p><lb/>During the night, I awoke, and heard distinctly an unknown <lb/>noise,
                    seemingly not far from the tent, resembling both the growl <lb/>of an angry cat,
                    and the low bleating of a calf. Perceiving <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother

                    <lb/>beautiful prospect towards the west. A very high peaked moun<lb break="no"

                    the other hills. It looked like a huge vulcano. Under <lb/>it lay three ridges
                    of subordinate hills, of various shapes, one <lb/>rising above the other. The

                    whole was worthy of the <lb/>the pencil of a <persName>Nicholson</persName>.
                    Both <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> and I endeavoured <lb/>to obtain an exact

                <p><lb/>As to our departure, we remained some time in unpleasant un<lb break="no"

                <p><lb/>Meanwhile <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName> reported, that on going to

                    a huge arm chair, above a yard wide, out of which she <lb/>was scarcely able to
                    lift herself. She had expressed a wish to see <lb/>the whole of our party, and
                    certainly, though she herself would <lb/>excite as much curiosity in <placeName

                    inhabited, may be dignified by that name. It con<lb break="no"/>sisted of an

                    covered with a roof of rushes. The entrance was <lb/>through the uncovered part.
                    In this vestibule three or four naked <lb/>slave-children were crawling about; a
                    woman, partially clothed in <lb/>rags, with a child strapped to her breast, was
                    cooking some victuals <lb/>at a fire, and dirt, guts, old shoes, rags of

                    <lb/>entering the main apartment, the first thing that met the eye, was <lb/>the
                    carcase of a sheep just killed, hanging from a cross-beam with <lb/>a pool of
                    blood on the clay floor, under the head; five fox-coloured <lb/>cats were
                    sitting round, watching for their share of the spoil: <lb/>a milk-pail, churn,
                    and some other kitchen utensils to the right; <lb/>and to the left, the lady
                    herself, who kindly invited <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName>
                    <lb/>to come and sit down on a stool, between her and the pendant <lb/>carcase.
                    Her husband, a very civil, old man, with a grey beard, <lb/>and a large straw
                    hat, sat at the table, and a bench was placed for <lb/>us, between the carcase
                    and the door. The lady herself entered <lb/>freely into conversation, told us,
                    that notwithstanding her enor<lb break="no"/>mous bulk, she was only forty-three
                    years old, and good-humour<lb break="no"/>edly observed, that <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister
                        Schmitt</persName> looked now only like a little <lb/>girl, passing several
                    jokes on the difference between them. Her <lb/>face still retained some vivacity
                    and comeliness. Her body en<lb break="no"/>tirely filled the vast chair she sat
                    in, on the arms of which her <lb/>elbows rested. She intended soon to remove to
                    another habita<lb break="no"/>tion on <placeName role="mentioned">Serjeants
                        Revier</placeName>. When once hoisted into the waggon, she <lb/>can no more
                    quit it, till she arrives at the place of her destination. <lb/>From her wooden
                    throne, she issued her commands to her slaves, <lb/>Hottentots, and brutes, with
                    the same shrill voice, for which the <lb/>African ladies are noted. Close to the
                    dwelling, was the beast<lb break="no"/>kraal, and the surrounding premises
                    exhibited a congeries of lumber, <lb/>rags, ruin, and disorder, not to be
                    described. Through all this <lb/>chaos, ran a small stream of spring-water,
                    clear as chrystal, in vain <lb/>offering its aid to cleanse the Augean stable.
                    The lady, however, <lb/>conscious of mortality, had already provided herself
                    with a coffin <lb/>of immense size, which, with her gigantic bed, is screened
                    off the <lb/>apartment by a bulk-head of matting.</p>
                <p><lb/>The old gentleman walked with us to our encampment, and not <lb/>only gave
                    good advice, but agreed with <persName>Mr. Akkerman</persName> who had fol<lb

                    through an uninteresting country, till, about <date when-iso="1816-04-01T13:00">one o’clock</date>, <lb/>we arrived at

                    farm</rs>. We here procured sweet milk <lb/>and good bread. Some dragoons
                    seemed pleased to meet with their <lb/>countrymen, and <persName>Mr.
                        Akkerman</persName>, with the old farmer from <placeName role="mentioned"
                            >Essen<lb break="no"/>bosch</placeName>, had preceded us on horseback.
                    Relays being soon provided, <lb/>we set out for <rs type="place" role="mentioned"><rs type="person">the Veldcornet</rs>’s</rs>, hoping to
                    reach his place before <lb/>dark. The road, however, was bad, and we got on but
                    slowly. <lb/>Several antelopes were seen, but their swiftness saved them, nor
                    <lb/>had we dogs used to the <sic>chace</sic>. On the road we met a serjeant of
                    <lb/>dragoons with a private. The former had been at <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Groenekloof</placeName>, and <lb/>was acquainted with the missionaries,
                    with whom he entered into <lb/>conversation, and seemed quite in a kind of
                    ecstacy, speaking of <lb/>the religious disposition of all classes of people
                    about <placeName role="mentioned">Uitenhagen</placeName>. <lb/>He was sent to
                    call off all the dragoons stationed on the road, as <lb/>that mode of conveying
                    dispatches is rendered unnecessary, by the <lb/>conclusion of the war with the
                    rebellious boors.</p>
                <p><lb/>When we arrived at <rs type="place" role="visited">the Veldcornet’s</rs>,
                    we found him very much <lb/>out of humour. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>,
                    who first entered the house to an<lb break="no"/>nounce us, met with a very
                    ungracious reception, though we had <lb/>sent <persName>Leonhard
                        Paerl</persName> to him with <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs>’s order for relays. In <lb/>his
                    absence, his wife had ordered them, but he pretended ignorance, <lb/>and rudely
                    asked, “Who are you? What is your business at <placeName role="mentioned"
                            >Uiten<lb break="no"/>hagen</placeName>?” with other questions equally
                    impertinent. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>
                    <lb/>replied, that we should inform <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs> of our business, when <lb/>we
                    reached <rs type="place" role="mentioned">the drosty</rs>, and meanwhile required him to furnish us <lb/>with the means
                    of proceeding. When the rest of us followed, he <lb/>began to use language which
                    soon convinced us, that we should be <lb/>much happier in our tent, than under
                    his roof. We therefore took <lb/>leave, pitched the tent on the werft, and
                    kindled a fire. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister <lb/>Schmitt</persName> had previously

                    <lb/>slaves to bring a sheep to the waggons. They did so, cut its <lb/>throat,
                    and left it to bleed, without informing either us or our <lb/>Hottentots, who
                    accidentally found it weltering in its blood. <lb/>This extraordinary conduct
                    gave us no favourable opinion of the <lb/>character of our ungracious host.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-04-02">2d.</date> About <date when-iso="1816-04-02T04:00">four in the morning</date>, I heard a
                    noise in the tent, <lb/>and thinking that <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>’s
                    dog, Rambler, who always slept <lb/>there, was seeking something to eat among
                    the plates, sat up and <lb/>called to him, when a large black dog passed close
                    by me, and <lb/>ran out. He had devoured the candle, emptied the butter pot,
                    <lb/>containing about two pounds of butter, and would have made <lb/>a better
                    breakfast, had he not been disturbed. When I left the <lb/>tent at day-break, I
                    saw <rs type="person">the Veldcornet</rs> and another person stand<lb break="no"/>ing on the werft.
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> accompanied me to him, to in<lb break="no"
                    />quire, when we might hope to be forwarded on our journey. To <lb/>our
                    surprise, we found him disposed to be more civil, and he in<lb break="no"
                    />formed us, that we might expect oxen by <date when-iso="1816-04-02T08:00">eight o’clock</date>. As he <lb/>seemed open
                    to remonstrance, we inquired the cause of his mark<lb break="no"/>ed rough
                    treatment of us yesterday evening. He made an apo<lb break="no"/>logy, by
                    explaining, how he was continually harassed by orders for <lb/>Vorspann, caring
                    for the transport of the military and their bag<lb break="no"/>gage, and put to
                    the inconvenience of sending his men up and <lb/>down the country, instead of
                    doing work in his own farm, by <lb/>which he sustained more injury, than any
                    exemption from taxa<lb break="no"/>tion could possibly repair, and was prevented
                    from erecting ne<lb break="no"/>cessary buildings, and putting his place into
                    better order. He <lb/>appealed to a dragoon, who stood by, and added, that his
                    patience <lb/>and temper were so much tried, and himself fatigued by conti<lb
                        break="no"/>nual calls, and riding about to secure the oxen ordered, that it
                    <lb/>was no wonder, that he could not contain himself. His apology <lb/>was
                    gladly admitted, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> only observing, that his

                    and <lb/>without using insulting language. Our quarrel was then made up,
                    <lb/>and he entered into friendly conversation with <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother

                    <lb/>heavy with some of the former possessors of this land, who, first
                    <lb/>having robbed the aborigines of their paternal inheritance, took
                    <lb/>advantage of their tame and defenceless state, to thrust them <lb/>down
                    into the most abject servitude. In this, they are, by some, <lb/>far worse

                    <lb/>seven branches, one in the centre, and six surrounding it at regular
                    <lb/>distances. The centre branch was a foot and a half long, the rest
                    <lb/>about thirteen inches, all thickly covered with a succession of long,
                    <lb/>bell-shaped flowers, each orange-coloured at the stem, and passing
                    <lb/>into bright vermillion towards the top. The brilliant appearance <lb/>of
                    this huge flower, or mass of flowers, disposed like a chandelier, <lb/>and
                    mounted on a stem six feet in height, with a capital of massive <lb/>leaves
                    spreading above three feet in diameter, is beyond conception <lb/>grand. The

                    the <lb/>midst of this brown desert, we see the magnificent chandelier, or

                    <lb/>half, in the spread of its rays, growing luxuriantly among stones <lb/>and
                    sand.</p>
                <p><lb/>Unexpectedy, we found ourselves on the brow of a descent into <lb/>a
                    charming vale, called the <placeName role="visited">Soute Kloof</placeName>. We
                    dismounted and <lb/>walked into it. The whole country assumed a different
                    character, <lb/>as we approached the <placeName role="visited_nearby">Chamtoos
                        Revier</placeName>. The descent into the <lb/><placeName role="visited"
                        >Soute Kloof</placeName> promised fair for a change in mineralogical
                        appear<lb break="no"/>ances, for it was covered with fragments of a bluish
                    quartz, with <lb/>mica, and a disposition in the fissures of the quartz to
                        chrystali<lb break="no"/>zation. A soft shistus broke forth in several
                    places, but towards the <lb/>bottom, all these favourable symptoms vanished, and
                    the old com<lb break="no"/>binations of sand-stone coloured by iron, with opaque
                    veins of quartz, <lb/>disappointed my wishes. Our attention, however, was
                    sufficiently <lb/>engrossed by the ever-changing scenery of this lovely spot.
                    The <lb/>elegant, but troublesome mimosa, occupies the greatest part of <lb/>the
                    wood, so as to render it in some parts impervious.</p>
                <p><lb/>In passing over a gentle eminence, we were struck by the view <lb/>of a
                    remarkable cavern to the right, and left the waggons, that we <lb/>might go and
                    examine it. It consisted of a natural arch of about <lb/>twenty feet span, the
                    rock composed entirely of smaller or larger <lb/>pebbles, cemented together by a
                    ferruginous clay, so as to constitute <lb/>a coarse pudding-stone. The whole
                    appearance of the cavern was, <lb/>in miniature, not unlike <rs type="place"

                <p><lb/>Leaving the narrow glens about the <placeName role="visited">Soete
                        Kloof</placeName>, we crossed a <lb/>level piece of ground, loosely covered

                        Bird</persName>’s list, and found them all occupied, or in requisition.
                    <lb/>The farmer from the <placeName role="mentioned">Chamtoos drift, on
                            <placeName role="mentioned">Klein Revier</placeName></placeName>, was at
                    the <lb/>house, and took a lift in our waggon across the ford. The <placeName
                        role="visited">Cham<lb break="no"/>toos</placeName> is a considerable river.
                    Its stream is clear and sweet, and we <lb/>regaled ourselves with a good draught
                    of these waters, which we <lb/>had been so long seeking, but cannot make our
                    own. All ac<lb break="no"/>counts agree, that every habitable spot on this river
                    is occupied, <lb/>and the poor Hottentots have even been deprived of their right
                    to <lb/>a place on <placeName role="mentioned">Klein Revier</placeName>, which a
                    former Governor had reserved for <lb/>them. <rs type="person">The captain</rs> having been decoyed away
                    under some pretext <lb/>or other, and no more heard of, for want of an heir to
                    succeed him, <lb/>the right to dispose of the land fell into the hands of
                    Government. <lb/>The English Governors intended to restore it to the Hottentots,
                    <lb/>and it had been mentioned to me as a place suitable for a Mission; <lb/>but
                    being already in possession of a farmer, though without a grant <lb/>from
                    Government, I and my Brethren agreed, that here also, in <lb/>fixing upon a spot
                    for a settlement, we would not, by any means, <lb/>thwart the views, or oppose
                    the pretensions, however slight, of any <lb/>individual. We therefore resolved
                    to proceed to <placeName role="mentioned">Uitenhagen</placeName>, and

                    <lb/>mimosa, on level ground, till we arrived at the <placeName role="visited"
                        >Klein Revier</placeName>, when <lb/>the farmer left us. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr.
                        Melville</persName> went with him across the river, <lb/>in a canoe, half
                    full of water, and returned with a bottle of sweet <lb/>milk. Meanwhile I took
                    the portrait of one of our oxen, whose <lb/>horns spread to a greater extent,
                    than any I had seen, the points <lb/>being nearly six feet asunder. The brute
                    stood patiently for his <lb/>picture, but on attempting to measure his horns, he
                    offered to use <lb/>them in a way, that kept even his driver at a respectful
                    distance.</p>
                <p><lb/>We now entered a country similar to that in the <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Soete Kloof</placeName>. <lb/>The road winds through a low wood, and is
                    extremely rugged, and <lb/>full of holes. Many curious caverns appear in the
                    hills on both <lb/>sides. From the kloofs, we ascended a barren hill, consisting
                    of <lb/>masses of iron-stone, the surface of some appearing as if they had
                    <lb/>been in the fire. They lay upon white clay, in some places pow<lb
                        break="no"/>dered, and mixed with sand. At sunset, we intended to encamp
                    <lb/>for the night, but as the Hottentots assured us, that it was only an
                    <lb/>hour’s drive to a much better out-spann place on the <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Louri Revier</placeName>, <lb/>we continued our journey
                    over the edge of a barren hill. Descend<lb break="no"/>ing into the <placeName
                        role="visited">Louri Revier</placeName> vale, we all left the waggons, as it
                    was <lb/>with great difficulty, and even hazard, that they were brought
                    <lb/>down in safety, the road winding through a dark wood, full of holes
                    <lb/>and dangerous slopes. It was a fine star-light night. All nature
                    <lb/>seemed hushed in peace, except that now and then the croak of <lb/>some
                    nocturnal bird, or some unusual sound at a distance, or on the <lb/>nearer hill,
                    attracted our attention. Knowing that these woods <lb/>are haunted by tygers,
                    wolves, and buffaloes, we frequently fan<lb break="no"/>cied those sounds to
                    proceed from some greedy throats, in search of <lb/>prey, and they occasioned
                    just enough of alarm, to add some speed <lb/>to our progress, and make us glad
                    to hear the barking of dogs at <lb/>the distant farm. There we had intended to
                    spend the night, but <lb/>when the waggons with <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother

                        Schmitt</persName> was alarmed by distinctly <lb/>hearing tygers growling in
                    the woods, on the hill nearest to our en<lb break="no"/>campment. She got up
                    quietly, Rambler following her, and went <lb/>to the Hottentots, who were lying
                    about the fire. By their report, <lb/>she found that she was not mistaken. But
                    not willing to alarm <lb/>us, though I saw her return, and spoke to her, she did
                    not mention <lb/>it, till we rose in the morning. No traveller, however, need be
                    <lb/>afraid of the tyger of this country entering a tent. Unless attacked,
                    <lb/>or conceiving himself to be in danger, he cautiously avoids med<lb

                    but if prevented from escaping, is most furious and deter<lb break="no"/>mined
                    in self-defence. The woods about the <placeName role="mentioned">Chamtoos</placeName> and
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Louri <lb/>Reviers</placeName> are said to abound with them, and the very

                <p><lb/><persName>Marcus</persName> and <persName>Johannes</persName> attended the

                    distributed upon the hills, in copses, or stands <lb/>singly. Here and there a

                    high trees ornament the sides of <lb/>the hills. Distant mountains of singular
                    outline, with a nearer <lb/>range of lower hills, ending towards the sea, with
                    one of a coni<lb break="no"/>cal form, present a most interesting horizon to the

                    where we were most kindly received, and hos<lb break="no"/>pitably treated.
                    Thick milk, bread of excellent quality, and a <lb/>fried sausage were set before
                    us. The old farm-house was burnt <lb/>by the Caftres during the late invasion,
                    and its ruins exhibited a <lb/>proof of their savage mode of warfare.
                        <persName>Mr. Neukirch</persName> was im<lb break="no"/>mediately ready to

                    <lb/>separated from my companions, I could not accept his kind <lb/>invitation.
                    Speaking of the aim of our journey, he offered every <lb/>assistance in his
                    power, and seemed to wish to see a settlement of <lb/>the Brethren formed in his
                    district. For this purpose, he men<lb break="no"/>tioned <placeName

                            Revier</placeName>, as being a very <lb/>suitable situation,
                    with every requisite for a village of about five <lb/>hundred inhabitants, which
                    we might claim, the present tenant <lb/>not having obtained any grant of the
                    land. He likewise described <lb/>another place in <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Achter Bruntjes Hoogte</placeName>, as suitable, the lease <lb/>of which
                    was about to be called in by Government, as the pos<lb break="no"/>sessor had
                    been concerned in the late rebellion, and sentenced to <lb/>be removed from that
                    part of the frontier. One of his sons had <lb/>been executed, and another
                    banished, having been convicted of <lb/>treason. <rs type="person">The

                <p><lb/>On my return to the tent, we held some consultation about the <lb/>proposals
                    made by <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs>, but could come to no determina<lb

                        role="mentioned">the Klein Revier <lb/>farm</rs>, the same objections
                    prevailed, which I have before stated; <lb/>and we felt uncomfortable in the
                    idea of occupying a place, of <lb/>which an old tenant and his family had been
                    deprived, though as <lb/>a just punishment for their misdeeds. <persName>Colonel
                        Cuyler</persName> followed <lb/>me to our encampment, to invite the whole

                <p><lb/>During the forenoon, we were visited by several Hottentots <lb/>belonging to

                        drosty</placeName>. After dinner, we visited a young lion <lb/>chained in
                    the yard, larger than a mastiff, perfectly tame, of the <lb/>large black breed,
                    that is, having a black mane, and black bush at <lb/>the end of his tail, but
                    otherwise of a dingy brown, or tawny-colour. <lb/>Like others of the feline
                    tribe, he seemed fond of being stroked <lb/>and petted, and, like a house-cat,
                    shoved up against the person <lb/>fondling him. Yet it appeared prudent to keep
                    one’s hand at a <lb/>respectful distance from his wide mouth. He continually
                    uttered <lb/>a kind of friendly growl, the double base to a cat’s purring. A
                    <lb/>silver-grey monkey also, of singular beauty, full of tricks, but of
                    <lb/>what species I cannot tell, diverted us for some time. He had been <lb/>a
                    great favourite in the family, till, interfering too much with the
                    <lb/>children’s comforts, stealing their victuals, and doing other mischief,
                    <lb/>he was now sentenced to exhibit his pranks in the yard, on a pole <lb/>with
                    a bar across, where he yet retained his friendly disposition. <lb/>Both the lion
                    and monkey had been inhabitants of the neighbour<lb break="no"/>ing hills.</p>

                    place, so totally destitute of any thing pic<lb break="no"/>turesque.</p>
                <p><lb/>We had been willing to believe, that the very unfavourable ac<lb break="no"

                        >Bethelsdorp</placeName>, were greatly exaggerated, <lb/>if not altogether
                    false, and that it was not to be credited, that a <lb/>Society, possessed of
                    such ample means, would suffer any of their <lb/>settlements to remain in so
                    disgraceful a state, as to be always <lb/>brought forward against them, as a
                    proof of the unprofitableness of <lb/>their missionary exertions in this
                    country. But I am sorry to say, <lb/>that as to its external situation, nothing
                    can be more miserable and <lb/>discouraging. Men, therefore, who judge only from
                    outward ap<lb break="no"/>pearance, are apt to draw inferences to the prejudice
                    of its inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants. This is acknowledged by <persName>Mr.
                        Campbell</persName> himself, and he <lb/>offers an apology, which such as

                    Not a tree is to be seen, excepting two or <lb/>three ragged speckbooms,

                    tame and <lb/>uninteresting. The small brook, if it deserves that name, comming
                    <lb/>out of the kloof, is quite insufficient for the purposes of irrigation,
                    <lb/>or to supply water for a mill; nor could we comprehend, how so <lb/>large a

                    This being a time, when most of the inhabitants <lb/>are with the boors, we saw
                    very few of them, nor did they appear <lb/>disposed to notice us. The arrival of

                    consists of two <lb/>buildings, placed together nearly in a right angle. The
                    inner <lb/>walls meet; the outer are connected by a wall, elliptical in its
                    <lb/>form. In the middle of this junction, the minister’s seat and desk <lb/>are
                    placed; thus he may be seen and heard by the whole audience, <lb/>though the men
                    and women, who sit separate, cannot see each <lb/>other. The building is low,
                    with small square windows, thatched, <lb/>and without a ceiling. A small room or
                    closet is boarded off on <lb/>the men’s side, containing what is called
                        <rs type="place" role="visited">the library</rs>. The <lb/>books are
                    chiefly for the use of the school, besides some religious <lb/>publications. A

                    has made a <lb/>garden, which produces a good crop. The other gardens do
                    <lb/>not look well, for want of trees and hedges. The mill was quite <lb/>out of

                    the full force of the scanty supply of water. On <lb/>returning from the kloof,

                        (or White river)</placeName>, flowing from the eastward into the <placeName

                    abundance of good grass, wood, and <lb/>water, was yet unoccupied, and might be

                    therefore <lb/>advised us, by all means, to go and see it, and as <rs type="person"><persName>Mr.

                <p><lb/>On my return to the tent, I made a report of this new proposal, <lb/>and all

                    not be <lb/>satisfied, to see a place so long in possession of the family,

                    and pleasant, and as a token of special favour, he presented

                    which might be affectation, but in a <lb/>humbling sense of our sin and need,
                    and in a broken heart and <lb/>contrite Spirit. The Lord was not in the wind,

                    wishes for our success, Our <lb/>departure was delayed till near <date when-iso="1816-04-09T09:00">nine o’clock</date>.
                    The caravan consisted <lb/>of our two waggons, each with ten oxen and a guide,
                    two of our <lb/>own horses, three from <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs>’s
                    stables, and two Hottentot <lb/>soldiers, armed with musquets, and dressed in
                    green jackets, with <lb/>a powder-horn and knapsack.</p>
                <p><lb/>On quitting <placeName role="visited">Uitenhagen</placeName>, we soon
                    entered the same kind of <lb/>thicket of brush-wood and bushes, which surround
                    the village on <lb/>all sides, and cover every eminence. Our attention was again
                    <lb/>much engaged with the curious plants and flowers, growing luxu<lb
                        break="no"/>riantly among the bushes. Now and then we sent one of the men
                    <lb/>to fetch some remarkable flower for our inspection. Here, for <lb/>the
                    first time, we saw Hottentots riding on oxen. The halter or <lb/>bridle, is
                    fastened to a piece of wood, passing through the carti<lb break="no"/>lage of
                    the nose, by which the beast is easily guided. In about <lb/>two hours, we
                    reached <rs type="place" role="visited">a farm, with a decent-looking dwelling<lb
                            break="no" type="hyphenated"/>house, and a mill</rs>.
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> walked with me down the
                    <lb/>river-side, to <rs type="place" role="visited">the mill</rs>. The main
                    wheel lay horizontally, the wa<lb break="no"/>ter taking the cogs sideways. This
                    kind of water-mill is common <lb/>here, of very simple construction, but has but

                <p><lb/>The next place we touched at, was on the <placeName role="visited">Kouga

                    family, from whom we <lb/>purchased milk and butter. While I was admiring a
                    large favourite <lb/>cat, the farmer observed, that he valued that creature as
                    much <lb/>as the best of his numerous dogs. She destroyed not only mice <pb

                    killed them with her teeth.</p>
                <p><lb/>The road continued to lead through bushes, during the whole of <lb/>the day,

                    forward in full <lb/>trot. This made us rather uneasy, especially when it grew
                    dark, <lb/>our own people being unacquainted with the road; but when <lb/>we
                    arrived, we forgave them, on finding that they had kindled a <lb/>large fire in
                    the wood, and fixed upon a place of shelter for our <lb/>tent. The weather now
                    seemed to clear up, and the moon shone <lb/>bright. Two fires were kindled, to
                    which we dragged branches <lb/>of trees, if possible, to keep them blazing
                    through the night, as a <lb/>guard against wild beasts, buffaloes having been
                    observed by our <lb/>horsemen to enter the wood before them, and elephants being
                    <lb/>often seen in these parts. I slept in the baggage-waggon; and to<lb

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-04-09">9th.</date> When we rose, the clouds had

                    this was the day, when we <lb/>hoped to see the spot, on which, if it so please

                <p><lb/>One of our Hottentot soldiers having shot a brace of wild Guinea<lb

                    covered with <lb/>a forest of great extent on each side. Its bed is full of
                    large round <lb/>stones, which makes the ford unpleasant. The water was about
                    <lb/>three feet in depth, but in the rainy season, the stream is very deep
                    <lb/>and rapid. As soon as we had mounted the heights, and got through <lb/>the
                    wood, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> found some sport. Chase was made after
                    <lb/>antelopes, and wild hogs, but in vain: an unlucky falcon, however,
                    <lb/>perching upon a tree, was brought down by a bullet. It was a <lb/>large,

                    either <lb/>standing singly, or in clumps. We directed our course towards a
                    <lb/>range of woody hills, and into a valley, through which the <placeName

                    in a friendly way. We produced <lb/>the order from <rs type="person">the

                    guide, the Hottentot soldier being well acquainted with the place. <lb/>The
                    English soldiers here behaved to us with great civility. They <lb/>showed us
                    several skins of animals they had shot in the neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood,
                    among which were those of a buffaloe, some tygers, a lynx, <lb/>a jerboa, called

                    verdure. We were <lb/>charmed with the variety of trees and bushes, through
                    which we <lb/>rode, and noticed several large butterflies, with wings of the

                    on some business, but soon returned to us, when <lb/>he gave us every
                    information respecting the premises. The river, <lb/>which we crossed several
                    times, at fording-places, darkened by the <lb/>shade of lofty trees, runs with a
                    rapid stream over a stony bed, <lb/>here and there dipping under heaps of
                    stones. These, in my <lb/>opinion, having been brought down from the mountains
                    by floods, <lb/>have accumulated to a height above the common level of the

                    163). In some places, the river forms <lb/>a fine broad surface, passing
                    quietly, though rapidly, along. As this <lb/>was not the rainy season, there
                    appears to be, at all times, a suffi<lb break="no"/>ciency of water for every

                <p><lb/>But much as we were pleased, and almost enchanted, with the <lb/>beauty of
                    the glen, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> at first objected to its narrow
                    <lb/>width, which indeed, on entering, appeared little more than a few

                    containing <lb/>large timber. A range of lower eminences lies at their foot;

                    <lb/>appearance. Their tops are covered with bushes, the lower region
                    <lb/>steep, and, in many places, supported, as it were, by rocks of a deep
                    <lb/>red colour. These rocks are concrete masses of pebbles and clay,

                    <lb/>of the valley, we rode towards the right and left boundaries, to

                        at<lb break="no"/>tracted by the appearance of a high red rock, we turned
                    towards it, <lb/>and found it rising perpendicularly beyond a large sheet of
                    water. <lb/>Between it and another rock on the opposite bank, a woody glen
                    <lb/>descended, probably containing some stream, contributing towards <lb/>the
                    formation of the lake or pond. Both in and out of the wood, <lb/>we had
                    discovered abundant traces of elephants, both by their foot<lb break="no"
                    />marks, their sleeping-places, their dung, and by several thorn-bushes,
                    <lb/>torn up by the roots and placed on their crowns, that these creatures
                    <lb/>might eat both the leaves and the more tender roots, of which they <lb/>are
                    said to be particularly fond. We now found the whole field <lb/>near the pond
                    covered with their dung, which shows that they fre<lb break="no"/>quently resort
                    to this place, for water. In the day-time, they gene<lb break="no"/>rally hide
                    themselves in the large woods and kloofs, but at night, de<lb break="no"/>scend
                    to quench their thirst. Leaving the pond, we crossed a stony <lb/>eminence and
                    descended into the glen, where the Caffres in <date when-iso="1797">1797</date>
                    <lb/>had their chief encampment.</p>
                <p><lb/>This glen intersects the main valley. To the left, it forms a pas<lb

                    <lb/>here assume singular forms. <persName>Mr. Scheper</persName> justly
                    compared one of <lb/>them to a fortification; semicircular caverns appearing in

                    <lb/>passing through his premises, without danger of an attack from <lb/>them,
                    if not immediately killed.</p>
                <p><lb/>The old farm-house and out-houses were demolished by the <lb/>Caffres, <date
                        when-iso="1801" precision="medium">about fifteen years ago</date>. The
                    present dwelling, put <lb/>up in place of the house burnt by those ferocious
                    invaders, is a <lb/>hovel, not much better than a Hottentot’s bondhoek. We found
                        <lb/><persName>Mrs. Scheper</persName> at home, and met with a friendly
                    reception. Some <lb/>dragoons stationed here, seemed likewise pleased with a
                    visit <lb/>from their countrymen. If this delightful spot were situated in a
                    <lb/>country, where protection might be had from wild beasts, and still
                    <lb/>wilder men, it would be coveted by every lover of fine scenery, and
                    <lb/>fetch a great price. But here it is of little value, as long as the
                    <lb/>unhappy disturbances between the boors and the Caffres continue <lb/>to
                    exist, even when no actual war is carried on. <persName>Mrs. Scheper</persName>,
                    who <lb/>was a person of better appearance and manners than many of her
                    <lb/>class, grew eloquent in describing their situation: “What signi<lb

                <p><lb/>This beautiful valley is indeed, at present, the habitation of seve<lb
                        break="no"/>ral wild animals, but would cease to be so, if inhabited by any
                    <lb/>number of human beings. It is now merely the passage of a few <lb/>persons,
                    between the farms at each end, except, that while they <lb/>are military posts,
                    some soldiers pass to and fro. We were <lb/>told, that some time ago, a soldier,
                    walking alone, came suddenly <lb/>upon an elephant, (which may happen, if the
                    creature is to lee<lb break="no"/>ward, so as not to perceive the approach of
                    man by his smell). <lb/>Whether the soldier made the first attack or not, is not
                    known, but <lb/>the elephant, after treading off his leg and thigh, hip and all,
                    threw <lb/>the body into the bushes. The limb, trodden to pieces, was found
                    <lb/>in the road, with his cap and accoutrements, but not the body, till
                    <lb/>after some days. The elephant and rhinoceros consider large bushes <lb/>no
                    more as impediments to their progress, than a man does tufts <lb/>of grass in a
                    field. They are not to be stopt by common fences or <lb/>palings, and walk
                    unconcerned through the thickest underwood, in <lb/>a straight line, tearing up
                    or pressing down even stout thorn-bushes, <lb/>with stems as thick as a man’s
                    leg. Of this we saw frequent proofs <lb/>in the <placeName role="mentioned"
                        >Witte Revier Valley</placeName>. If, therefore, a settlement were made
                    <lb/>here, the first settlers might certainly be in danger of sometimes
                    <lb/>having their gardens and fields invaded, and even trodden down or
                    <lb/>grubbed up by these animals, and perhaps suffer other losses by ra<lb
                        break="no"/>venous beasts, who have hitherto considered the valley as their
                        pa<lb break="no"/>trimony. But, in a few years, the mischief would gradually
                    cease, <lb/>as these creatures retire from the habitations of man; which they
                    <lb/>are always known to do.</p>

                        role="visited_nearby">Boschberg</placeName>, the proposed extent of our
                    journey. <lb/>The sun had set, and we were anxious to reach the valley, the
                    <lb/>wind being high and very cold, but our guides declared it impos<lb
                        break="no"/>sible for the oxen to proceed a step farther. By blundering or
                    <lb/>ignorance, they also missed a place, where there was a sufficiency <lb/>of
                    water for their poor beasts; thus, after searching in vain, we were <lb/>obliged
                    to encamp on a dry spot, where very little fuel was to be <lb/>procured. The
                    moon shone bright, but the wind rose, and our <lb/>tent was nearly blown
                    down.</p>

                    night’s lodging, as soon <lb/>as the day dawned, we descended into the valley.
                    We were <lb/>overtaken by ten dragoons, and pleased to be able to serve one
                    <lb/>of them, by taking his and his horses accoutrements into our wag<lb

                    <lb/>singular plants on the <placeName role="visited">Zuurberg</placeName>, we
                    noticed a species of the <lb/>Wageboom, with a much broader leaf than that,
                    which we had <lb/>hitherto seen on the hills about the <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Kromm Revier</placeName>. The outside <lb/>was a dark
                    green, the inside silver-grey, covered with a white down. <lb/>At the bottom of
                    the hill, we encamped near a farm destroyed by <lb/>the Caffres, and forsaken,
                    where we found the bed of a brook, with <lb/>only a few puddles of muddy water
                    remaining in it. This, howe<lb break="no"/>ver, was all we could procure, both

                    unto the end of the world. Having seated ourselves, after <lb/>breakfast, in a

                    souls, and convince us, that “He <lb/>was wounded for our transgressions, and
                    bruised for our iniqui<lb break="no"/>ties,” and that the word of His Cross
                    might approve itself the <lb/>Power of God in this country also, for the

                    forth to notice our arrival, <lb/>much less a human being. The place was
                    surrounded by a mud<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>wall and a ditch. The wall
                    had loop-holes, and small bastions at <lb/>the angles, sufficient to resist any
                    attack of undisciplined Caffres. <lb/>We entered this lonely place with some
                    caution, but found every <lb/>part of it completely emptied of furniture. Two or
                    three old hats <lb/>were lying about, which might have been very serviceable to
                    our <lb/>Hottentots, but they would not take them, observing, that their own<lb

                    <lb/>in not seizing upon three pigs, and a number of hens and chickens,
                    <lb/>running about the garden and bushes. Three small dogs, nearly <lb/>dead
                    with hunger, were lying within the wall. A fine cat came <lb/>purring towards us
                    out of a bush, which we fed and intended to <lb/>carry to the next post, but she
                    would not stay in the waggon.</p>
                <p><lb/>The whole situation, with the surrounding country, looked drea<lb break="no"

                        Melville</persName>, had the <lb/>smallest acquaintance. However, we were in
                    spirit with our con<lb break="no"/>gregations, adoring our risen Lord and
                    Saviour, who, though with<lb break="no"/>drawn from mortal sight, is present
                    with His people, in every corner <lb/>of the earth. The result of our
                    deliberations was, that I should take <lb/><persName>old Paerl</persName>, and
                    ride to <rs type="place" role="mentioned"><persName>Dr. Mackrill</persName>’s house</rs>, previously to announce
                    <lb/>the party. After crossing the river, and reaching the top of the <lb/>bank,
                    the country assumed the appearance of a park. The land was <lb/>covered with
                    short grass, and the thorn-bush, dispersed in clumps, <lb/>or standing singly,
                    its greatest ornament. The mountains of <placeName role="visited_nearby">the
                        <lb/>Boschberg</placeName> had a pleasant appearance, illumined by a
                    morning-sun. <lb/><rs type="place" role="visited"><persName>Dr. Mackrill</persName>’s
                        house</rs> lies under one of the highest parts of the range, <lb/>and
                    is a small neat building of unburnt brick, stuccoed. Adjoining <lb/>to it, are
                    several out-houses, and huts for his slaves. The premises <lb/>have a much
                    cleaner appearance than those of even the most re<lb break="no"/>spectable
                    farmers in the country, with whom neatness and cleanli<lb break="no"/>ness
                    seldom enter into calculation. One of them once answered an <lb/>observation I
                    made on the subject, thus; “What should I be the rich<lb break="no"/>“er for it?
                    Plantations, and the other arrangements you propose, <lb/>“would cost me money,

                    <lb/>is an Englishman. The name of <placeName role="visited">Somerset</placeName> has been

                        <rs type="person">The Doctor</rs>, to <lb/>whom I presented the letter from
                        <persName>Colonel Cuyler</persName>, received me with <lb/>great politeness,
                    and immediately dispatched a servant to the river, <lb/>to bring in the whole
                    party. After breakfast, we went out to view <lb/>the garden. It lies at the foot
                    of the mountain, and is stored, not <lb/>only with a great abundance of every
                    kind of garden-produce, but, <lb/><rs type="person">the Doctor</rs>, being a good
                    botanist, has transplanted into it a great <lb/>many of the flowering plants
                    from the wilderness and woods, and <lb/>by culture, very much improved their
                    quality and beauty. Here is <lb/>every thing requisite for an excellent garden:

                    </fw>
                    <lb/>richest soil, water in abundance, and hands to work. The orange, <lb/>and
                    other fruit-trees, appear in great perfection. <placeName role="visited_nearby">The
                        Boschberg</placeName>, <lb/>rising immediately behind the garden, is a
                    beautiful mountain, of <lb/>considerable height, intersected by many kloofs,
                    filled with wood, <lb/>the intermediate eminences, like buttresses, supporting
                    the moun<lb break="no"/>tain. They swell, towards the bottom, into hills of
                    fanciful shape, <lb/>covered with green sod of the richest hue, excepting where
                    the <lb/>wood stretches from the kloofs over part of them. At the top of
                    <lb/>these buttresses runs a horizontal ledge of rock, partly covered <lb/>with
                    bushes and creepers. A precipice of a red colour, with grey <lb/>veins, and
                    overhanging a wide kloof filled with timber-trees, has a <lb/>singular effect.
                    The region, beyond the rocky ledge, is rough, but <lb/>grassy. The mountain
                    recedes to the right and left, and, towards <lb/>the north-east, seems to rest
                    upon another range, of similar cha<lb break="no"/>racter. It has an even
                    outline, and, beyond the summit, on the <lb/>side of <placeName role="mentioned">Graaf
                        Reynet</placeName>, is said to shelve off more gradually.</p>
                <p><lb/>We observed two large baboons, sitting separately on projecting <lb/>rocks,
                    probably placed there by the troop, as centinels, to guard <lb/>against
                    surprise. Though somewhat intimidated by our shouts and <lb/>menacing gestures,
                    they seemed determined to keep their station, <lb/>sometimes slowly retreating a
                    few paces, and then returning to their <lb/>seats, showing their teeth and
                    grinning defiance.</p>
                <p><lb/>When we left the garden, passing by a low shed, a serpent, of <lb/>the most
                    vivid green colour, beautifully marked upon the back, and <lb/>spangled with
                    silver-coloured spots, reared its head from the <lb/>thatched roof, and hissed
                    at <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName>. He killed it with <lb/>his stick, and
                    brought it out. The Dutch call it, Dachslange, <lb/>(roof-serpent), as it seems
                    to like to hide in old thatch, and is <lb/>said to be very venomous.</p>
                <p><lb/>We now visited the shop, containing every article, of which either <lb/>the

                    many articles of convenience and comfort, might purchase them <lb/>here by
                    barter, or otherwise. Thus, friendly communication being <lb/>established, and

                    industry might, by degrees, be introduced.</p>
                <p><lb/>In this view, no objection can justly be raised to a creation of ad<lb

                    <lb/>philosophers may say of the happiness of a state of nature. To as<lb
                        break="no"/>sert, that at length, by abuse, it may end in greediness,
                        covetous<lb break="no"/>ness, and rapacity, is no more than saying, that
                    every faculty and <lb/>disposition of the human mind, may be turned, either to a
                    good or <lb/>bad use, as directed by a good, or perverted by an evil spirit. The
                    <lb/>original plan of the establishment at <placeName role="mentioned">Somerset</placeName>, was,
                    to improve the <lb/>extraordinary goodness of the ground belonging to the farm,
                    for the <lb/>cultivation of tobacco, which during the American war had risen
                    <lb/>to an enormous price in the colony. <persName>Dr. Mackrill</persName> being
                    a man of <lb/>extensive knowledge and active patriotism, proposed to Govern<lb
                        break="no"/>ment the improvement of the growth of that article in this
                        newly<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>acquired colony, not only with a view
                    to cheapen it here, but to <lb/>furnish a supply for exportation. Being
                    permitted to fix upon a <lb/>situation for that purpose, he wisely chose perhaps
                    the finest in <lb/>the whole <placeName role="mentioned">district of Uitenhagen</placeName>. But
                    the war ceasing, and tobacco <lb/>being again sold at a price so low, as to
                    destroy every prospect of <lb/>advantage to the colony, the plan was changed.
                    Corn is to be the <lb/>principal produce in future.</p>
                <p><lb/>After dinner, we took a walk to see the land belonging to the farm. <lb/>Its
                    boundary, to the eastward, is a rapid brook, proceeding from <lb/>the mountain,
                    and emptying itself into <placeName role="mentioned">the Little Fish River</placeName>. <lb/>The

                    are of extraordinary size and beauty. The brook <lb/>forms two very fine
                    cascades before it enters the river, and the <lb/>glen, through which it
                    descends, is truly romantic. The upper <pb n="231"/>

                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. P.</persName> is father to one of those lately executed:

                    />cocks, korhans, (black-cocks), and antelopes were seen. A large <lb/>puffader,

                    body upon the sand, which he did with a scraping <lb/>noise. The Hottentots were
                    extremely eager to pursue and de<lb break="no"/>stroy him; but to approach this
                    serpent is dangerous, as by <lb/>throwing himself backward, he is sure to wound

                        load<lb break="no"/>ed. He was about three feet long, and three inches in

                    heath and a <lb/>few low bushes. Here we were amused by the sight of some
                    <lb/>hundreds of springbocks, one of the most elegant antelopes of <lb/>this
                    country. They stood in parties of twenty or thirty to<lb break="no"/>gether, and
                    our sportsmen were all alive, endeavouring to ap<lb break="no"/>proach near

                    suffered them to approach to within gun<lb break="no"/>shot, when they set off
                    full speed, leaping sometimes over each <lb/>other. They bounded along, in a

                    then, swiftly facing about, <lb/>surveyed their pursuers. Sixteen shot were

                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> brought down a wild peahen, <lb/>which

                    hardly bid us welcome, but suffered us <lb/>to put up our tent on their dirty

                    to rest, intending to set out <lb/>as early as possible in the morning. About

                    parading up and down <lb/>the werft. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName> rising
                    and looking out, saw him coming <lb/>straight towards us. He pushed on between

                    another, where they hoped to find water, but in <lb/>vain. They then lifted up
                    their heads in bitter disappointment, <lb/>and bellowed forth their complaints.
                    Having sent our people <lb/>to the old forsaken kraal, to search for water, to
                    our great joy, <lb/>a pond was discovered, with fresh water in abundance. When
                    <lb/>driven to it, the oxen could hardly leave off drinking. Meanwhile <lb/>the
                    wind rose, and before we arrived at the top of the moun<lb break="no"/>tain, it
                    blew a hard gale. We therefore hurried down the other <lb/>side into the

                <p><lb/>Having left the waggon, I walked down the steep declivity <lb/>with

                    in <lb/>search of plants, and I, examining the stones. Having discovered
                    <lb/>some small crystals in a vein of quartz, I took up the stone, and
                    <lb/>feeling something soft under my thumb, turned it up, to see what <lb/>it
                    was. I found, that I was pressing upon a young tarantula, about <lb/>the size of
                    a halfpenny. Its legs, which were chequered with brown <lb/>and white, were
                    doubled under its body, the creature being probably <lb/>asleep. I shook it off,

                    partly with a view to keep off wild beasts, <lb/>with which these forests
                    abound. Our weary oxen found good <lb/>grass and some water in pools, and we
                    suffered them to feed for <lb/>two hours. They were then tethered to the

                    liked, and marched off through the fence, <lb/>towards a pool of water.
                        <persName>Captain Terry</persName>, who commanded here, <lb/>walked with

                    near the <lb/>road a great quantity of fresh dung, as likewise a large

                    which had crept into the basket, and were <lb/>given to the hungry dogs. Near

                    among <lb/>the bushes. Elephants and rhinoceroses had left so many traces of

                        <placeName role="mentioned">Nisky</placeName>, <lb/>in <placeName role="mentioned">Saxony</placeName>.</p>
                <p><lb/>We found <rs type="person_group"><persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Van Roy</persName></rs> at
                    home, and well pleased <lb/>with our visit. After some conversation, we inquired
                    about the <lb/>horns. He related, that about ten days ago, he had met with
                    <lb/>and shot at the buffaloe, in a wood not far off, and wounded him <lb/>in
                    the leg. The animal fled, but being pursued and brought down <lb/>by the dogs,
                    was shot a second time through the head. When <persName>Mr. <lb/>Van
                        Roy</persName> showed us the head, he said, that he meant to make a
                    <lb/>tobacco-pipe of the points of the horns. We expressed our re<lb break="no"
                    />gret, that so beautiful a pair of horns should be destroyed in that <lb/>way;
                    but he replied, that it would cost him five dollars to get a <lb/>pipe of that
                    kind. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName>, supposing him to mean that <lb/>each
                    horn would make one pipe, asked me, in English, whether I <lb/>would give ten
                    dollars for the head, to which I agreed. On hear<lb break="no"/>ing this, the
                    truly honest farmer exclaimed:—“Ten! no, I said, five <lb/>would be required to
                    get a tobacco-pipe, and I will take no more <lb/>from that gentleman.” A slave
                    was then set to work to cut off <lb/>the superfluous bone, and make it more
                    portable. He now <lb/>brought the head of a buffaloe cow, shot some time ago,
                    and <lb/>would have given it into the bargain, but I paid him what I had
                    <lb/>given for the first of the kind I purchased.</p>
                <p><lb/>He invited us to stay and dine with him. Among other <lb/>questions
                    respecting <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName>, and English customs, he laid a
                    <lb/>case before us, wishing to know, how he was to act, consistently <lb/>with
                    English law. One of his Hottentots had shot his neigh<lb break="no"/>bour’s
                    bull, mistaking him in the dark for a wild buffaloe. The <lb/>neighbour
                    required, that he should pay the damage, which he <lb/>refused, on the ground
                    that <hi rend="i">he</hi> had not shot it, and the Hot<lb break="no"/>tentot had
                    nothing to pay. We told him, that in <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName>, a
                    <lb/>master was responsible for the deeds of his servant, and the Hot<lb
                        break="no"/>tentot having done it, while employed by him, and with <hi
                        rend="i">his</hi> gun, <lb/>we thought, that he would get nothing by a suit,
                    but do best to <pb n="243"/>

                    </fw>
                    <lb/>compromise the affair, and pay for the bull. He spoke as a friend <lb/>to
                    the English, but regretted, that they were losing their popula<lb break="no"
                    />rity in the colony, by taxation, and the mode of settling the quit<lb
                        break="no"/>rents. He thought it hard, that when a man had done every
                    <lb/>thing in his power to improve his farm, by making water-courses <lb/>for
                    irrigation, clearing land, &amp;c. that those very improvements <lb/>should tell
                    against him, and he be charged a higher rent than his <lb/>neighbour, who was an
                    indolent man, suffering his estate to go to <lb/>decay, when, in fact, it was
                    better land, and more productive, <lb/>and therefore more able to bear the
                    burden; “But,” added he, <lb/>“we would bear taxation, if the English would only
                    keep a large <lb/>“military force in the country, as by that means, we should
                    ob<lb/>“tain a ready sale for our corn and other produce, and have
                    <lb/>“wherewith to pay. But now they are withdrawing their <lb/>“troops.” As
                    staunch friends to our country and its Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, we heard this
                    man’s very sensible remarks with concern, and <lb/>wished, that means might be
                    devised, consistent with the just and <lb/>benevolent disposition of our present
                    administration, to grant re<lb break="no"/>lief, and make the occupation of this
                    land by the British, consi<lb break="no"/>dered a blessing, and not a curse, as
                    we have sometimes heard it <lb/>called.</p>
                <p><lb/>We now returned to our encampment on the river, and found <lb/>that
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> had meanwhile proceeded with the
                        baggage<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>waggon to <rs type="place" role="visited">the Chamtoos
                        Wagendrift on <placeName role="visited">Klein Revier</placeName></rs>, whither
                    <lb/>we immediately followed, and reached the ford about sun-set. <lb/>The
                    farm-house was a miserable hovel, and could not afford a <lb/>lodging to our
                    party; yet, as it lightened much, and threatened to <lb/>rain, we were desirous
                    of obtaining better shelter than the tent. <lb/>After some search, we fixed upon
                    a forsaken blacksmith’s shop, <lb/>consisting of two small rooms, one containing
                    the forge and anvil, <lb/>the other empty. We got them well swept, and put down
                    our <lb/>mattrasses.</p>
                <p><lb/>Not feeling much disposed to sleep, I placed my desk upon <lb/>the anvil,
                    and, seated upon a wooden block, continued writing, <pb n="244"/>

                    <lb/>while my friends rested. It was a providential circumstance, that <lb/>I
                    remained awake. The door was made of rushes, fastened to<lb break="no"/>gether
                    with thongs, in a slender frame, and had no lock. The <lb/>rushes did not reach
                    to the top of the door-way, and I was twice <lb/>disturbed by a cat, scrambling
                    up from the outside, and jumping <lb/>over into our dormitory. This, however,
                    proved a slight dis<lb break="no"/>turbance. About <date when-iso="1816-04-24T00:00">midnight</date>, the bull and other
                    cattle broke out <lb/>of the kraal, and the unruly beast came bellowing up to
                    the <lb/>door, which he began to push about with his horns. I was <lb/>much
                    alarmed, as very little force was required to throw it down, <lb/>when we should
                    have had a very troublesome guest in our quar<lb break="no"/>ters. Being afraid
                    to face him in the dark, I made some noise <lb/>within, when he took himself
                    off, yet every now and then ap<lb break="no"/>proaching, in his perambulations.
                    I therefore immediately fell to <lb/>work, to make a fastening to the door, with
                    a piece of iron, found <lb/>in the forge, which I worked into the wall, and tied
                    to the door <lb/>with a strong thong. Yet, after all these precautions, I hardly
                        ven<lb break="no"/>tured to lie down. Between <date from-iso="1816-04-24T04:00" to-iso="1816-04-24T05:00">four and five in the morning</date>,
                    two <lb/>thunder storms, with heavy rain, passed successively over us, and
                    <lb/>we were thankful for the shelter we had found. They followed <lb/>the

                    Tall Geelhout<lb break="no"/>boom trees and other ever-greens exhibited some

                    <lb/>drift. He sent his men on, and returned with us. The dwelling<lb break="no"
                        type="hyphenated"/>house was on a rising ground, and little better than a
                    Hottentot bond<lb break="no"/>hoek. A hut stood near it, and these two miserable

                    <lb/>forth with splendour. The farm we had just left was forsaken by <lb/>the

                    <lb/>without due discrimination or knowledge of local circumstances. <lb/>We

                    them all to the yoke. Herein, they were assisted by the ha<lb break="no"/>bits
                    of the oxen themselves. Though they ran about, tossing their <lb/>heads, and
                    kicking furiously, and it sometimes seemed, as if they <lb/>would escape
                    altogether, yet they were made to return, by driving <lb/>two or three tame ones
                    after them, whom they immediately joined; <lb/>when, taking no particular notice
                    of the wild, and the tame ones <lb/>being easily driven back to the waggon, the
                    wild followed quietly, <lb/>and were again caught, by passing a thong with a

                    being soon procured, we passed by two farms in <placeName role="visited_nearby">the <lb/>Lange

                <p><lb/>On our arrival, we met with a very dry reception. Card-playing <lb/>occupied

                    general practice of the military, bestowed no kind <lb/>of attention upon his
                    countrymen. No invitation was given, nor <lb/>any assistance offered. Pitching
                    our tent upon the werft could not <lb/>well be refused, but we were left to get
                    fuel, where we could find it, <lb/>and to cook our own victuals. Though, in
                    general, we were most <lb/>happy and independent in our tent, yet we could not
                    but feel the af<lb break="no"/>front as intended; and the night being very cold,

                    to be sold on account of their <lb/>love of religion, especially as her son

                    his cows carried us, with great <lb/>speed, to <rs type="place" role="visited">a farm belonging to a

                    civilly treated by his black slave, and soon provided <lb/>with two spanns of
                    oxen, to bring us forward to <rs type="place" role="visited"><persName>Mr. Zondag</persName>’s farm,

                <p><lb/>During the short time of our stay at <persName>Mr. H.</persName>’s miserable
                    place, <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132526864">Mr. Melville</persName> had the unexpected pleasure of

                    had been his school-fellow. <lb/>Strolling about the premises, I noticed a

                    trodden out by <lb/>from ten to twenty or more horses, driven round it in a

                    <lb/>Whether this is a mode better calculated to secure the crop than

                <p><lb/>All the other buildings in this farm were wretched huts, and the

                    generally the case in this country. Yet the proprietor was <lb/>possessed of
                    what many English gentlemen cannot boast. He had <lb/>been at the funeral of a
                    neighbour’s child, unfortunately burnt to <lb/>death, and met us on the road in
                    his state-waggon, drawn by six <lb/>beautiful horses of equal size and colour,
                    driven by himself. Instead <lb/>of greeting us, he jumped off the box, and
                    demanded of his black <lb/>lad, what business he had to give us Vorspann. The
                    poor slave <lb/>had hardly time to reply, that he had acted conformably to his
                    own <lb/>commands, to furnish Vorspann in his absence, if ordered by
                        <rs type="person">the <lb/>Veldcornet</rs>, when he put himself into a furious
                    rage, attended with <lb/>hideous grimaces, so as to make himself truly
                    ridiculous, and threat<lb break="no"/>ening what he would do to his slave, when
                    he got home, mounted his <lb/>box, without paying any respect to our party, and
                    drove off. The <lb/>poor slave was exceedingly terrified, told us, that his
                    master was <lb/>a cruel tyrant, and would certainly give him a hard flogging on
                    his <lb/>return, with the achter shambock, the thickest whip cut out of the
                    <lb/>hippopotamus skin, and used to beat the shaft-oxen with. In pas<lb

                        <placeName role="visited">Wellgelegen</placeName>, who treated <lb/>us with tea-water. Here
                    we found a dark-coloured man, who tra<lb break="no"/>vels about as a

                    cyphering, spending a few weeks at a time at <lb/>one place, then going to
                    another, for the same purpose, there be<lb break="no"/>ing no schools in the
                    country. Of course, the proficiency made is <lb/>very small, and hardly
                    sufficient to qualify the scholars for the most <lb/>common uses of reading,
                    writing, and cyphering. To this want of <lb/>instruction must be ascribed the
                    general state of ignorance prevail<lb break="no"/>ing, with few exceptions,
                    among the inhabitants of the interior. The <lb/>schoolmaster was a very

                <p><lb/>By the specimens we had just seen of the behaviour of certain <lb/>farmers
                    in <placeName role="mentioned">the Lange Kloof</placeName>, we augured but unfavourably of the
                        re<lb break="no"/>ception we were likely to meet with at
                        <placeName role="visited">Avantur</placeName>, and afraid that <lb/>we should be obliged to
                    spend a cold, windy night, in our tent; but <lb/>herein we were most agreeably
                    dissappointed. Nothing could ex<lb break="no"/>ceed the cordial welcome we
                    experienced from <persName>Mr. Zondag</persName>. He <lb/>stood like an ancient
                    patriarch before his door, and as we walked <lb/>up to the house, held out his
                    hand, inviting us in the most friendly <lb/>manner, to enter, and make his house
                    our home. <rs type="person">His wife</rs> was <lb/>worthy of him, and in the kindest manner received

                    <lb/>and the whole party. Perhaps their friendliness and hospitality <lb/>was
                    rendered the more conspicuous and gratifying, in contrast <lb/>with the savage
                    conduct of those we had left; but the general be<lb break="no"/>haviour of
                        <persName type="group">the Zondags</persName> towards all persons in the
                    house, proved <lb/>them to have benevolent dispositions. The children, who were
                    yet <lb/>young, seemed to partake of the virtues of their parents, and be<lb
                        break="no"/>haved with unaffected good-will and confidence towards us. Two
                    <lb/>dragoons, entering the room, came up to us, shook hands, and, in
                    <lb/>lively terms, expressed their joy to see English faces, and hear their
                    <lb/>own language spoken. They were civil, well-bred young men. <lb/>After much
                    agreeable conversation, we were entertained by looking <lb/>over a large Dutch
                    bible, in folio, admirably well printed, and full <lb/>of good cuts, which was
                    valued as the chief jewel in the family. <lb/><persName>Little Peter</persName>,
                    a favourite boy, was employed to read some portions <lb/>of its contents, which
                    he did well, but the want of schools in the <lb/>country was much lamented by
                    the parents. That we might be the <lb/>better accommodated,
                        <rs type="person_group"><persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Zondag</persName></rs>, unknown to
                    us, gave <lb/>up their own room, and retired into the dragoons house to sleep.
                    <lb/>The latter went into the garret.</p>

                    <lb/>brownish-yellow. From the forehead along the back, three jet<lb break="no"
                        type="hyphenated"/>black streaks run towards the tail; the sides are marked
                    with large <lb/>single spots of the same colour; the tail has five black rings,
                    and <lb/>each ear two streaks. Broad black bands descend a little way, in

                    brought me <lb/>another still more beautiful, and well dressed. I inquired of

                    <lb/>for he had declined receiving any remuneration. He replied, that <lb/>as he
                    was “a great writer,” but could get no paper, and was oblig<lb break="no"/>ed to
                    write on any odd scrap he could find on the premises, some <lb/>paper would be
                    most acceptable. I gave him half a quire of fools<lb break="no"/>cap, and a few
                    pencils and pens, with which he seemed extremely <lb/>delighted.
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName> got here a supply of butter, apples,

                    with our company. The road to it was <lb/>dreadfully bad, and in crossing a
                    narrow ravine, with a deep brook <lb/>at the bottom, we were in some danger of
                    oversetting, but the <lb/>good people came out with lights, to show us the way
                    to the house. <lb/>The farmer immediately gave us the only room he could spare,
                    <lb/>which was at one end of what is called a hartebeest-house, being a

                    <lb/>though very small, was new, and clean, with two bed-steads in it. <lb/>Of

                    remaining, under the bed-steads. But we were thankful to be <lb/>under good
                    cover. It lightned incessantly; and during the night <lb/>a storm passed over
                    us, with loud thunder.</p>

                    this morning <lb/>sent forward to <rs type="place" role="mentioned">the drosty</rs> for punishment. He belonged to a

                    but he seemed quite stupified. The family behaved <lb/>with great civility, and

                    here all day. We <lb/>found here a pleasant family, and spent the day in

                    I obtained the skin of one, in barter for some <lb/>gunpowder. A Koodoo-skin was

                    him to finish his work, the bleeding of the lacerated gum <lb/>having brought
                    her some relief. No persuasion from her wiser <lb/>husband could prevail, to let

                <p><lb/>Though the Vorspann system was sometimes attended with un<lb break="no"

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-05-02">2d.</date> After breakfast, we were glad to see
                    two spanns of oxen ar<lb break="no"/>rive for our use. The country through which
                    we passed, was one <lb/>continued waste, thickly covered with plants and bushes.
                    Some <lb/>species of the thorn-bush and speckboom were new to me. In <lb/>two
                    hours, we arrived at <rs type="place" role="visited"><persName>the Veldcornet Wolfran</persName>’s
                        farm</rs>, but made <lb/>no stay. He came out to us, and gave us a
                    letter to the farmer <lb/>at <placeName role="visited">Saffran’s Revier</placeName> to furnish
                    us with fresh cattle, as his were too <lb/>young and weak to take us through
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Attaqua’s Kloof</placeName>. But when we <lb/>arrived at that
                    place, the farmer pretended, that he had no oxen <lb/>at home, though the
                    dragoons informed us, that he had enough <lb/>for five spanns, but had driven
                    them across the river, as soon as he <lb/>saw our waggons coming down the hill.
                    He seemed to be com<lb break="no"/>pletely under the <sic>controul</sic> of his

                    <lb/>must have encountered many of that description, when he drew <lb/>his
                    picture of the African boors and their ladies. We met with <lb/>but few, for in
                    general, they treated us with civility.</p>
                <p><lb/>Near this place, I found some very singular fossils in iron<lb break="no"
                    />stone, resembling screws, and in several places, the stones were <lb/>covered
                    with a bituminous crust.</p>
                <p><lb/>We perceived now, that the best way would be, quietly to <lb/>move on, and
                    to endeavour to work our way through the kloof, <lb/>with our weary oxen, as
                    well as we could. Having reached the <lb/>first steep ascent, we left the
                    waggons, and by a foot-path, joined <lb/>the road, on the other side of the
                    hill. Here we rested long, before <lb/>the waggons overtook us. Some curious
                    caverns attracting our <lb/>attention, we entered them. By some foot-marks in
                    the sand, we <lb/>perceived, that they afforded retreat to tyger-cats. They also
                    <lb/>provided shelter for travellers in rainy weather, there being here an
                    <lb/>outspann-place, and fire-places made under the overhanging rocks.
                    <lb/>Forgetting the caution I had prescribed to myself, when I touched <lb/>a
                    tarantula spider, on <placeName role="mentioned">the Zuurberg</placeName>, I lifted up a stone to
                        exam<lb break="no"/>ine it, and saw a young scorpion lying under it. I was
                    thankful <lb/>that I had escaped putting my hand upon it. Finding it impos<lb

                    <lb/>dark and cloudy, and seeing a fire on the mountain, we made <lb/>towards
                    it. It had been kindled by <persName>Lebrecht Aris</persName>, who had
                    <lb/>brought our purchased oxen thus far, and was preparing to rest <lb/>here.
                    We put up our tent, and though somewhat annoyed by <lb/>passing mists, commended
                    ourselves to the protection of God, <lb/>and spent a very quiet night in this
                    wild place.</p>

                    received us most civilly. Indeed our <lb/>visit seemed to put him into high
                    spirits. Though seventy-five <lb/>years old, he was remarkably strong and
                    lively, and full of merry <lb/>jokes. I felt at first much fatigued, but soon
                    recovered. Our <lb/>host came from the neighbourhood of <placeName role="mentioned">Gotha</placeName> in

                    called <placeName role="mentioned">Neudietendorf</placeName>, of which he gave us an

                    <lb/>institutions, though not quite like those of <persName>Madam de

                    a Dutch crimp, and brought <lb/>at last as a soldier to <placeName role="mentioned">the

                        Imme<lb break="no"/>diately the whole place was in an uproar: some great

                <p><lb/>The rain, which still continued to fall now and then in drizzling

                    the waggons up any ascent, and we were thankful that this <lb/>weather had not

                    <lb/>relished a dish of bean-soup more, than in this forlorn place. To <lb/>me
                    it was quite new. This man had travelled through a great <lb/>part of the north
                    of <placeName role="mentioned">Europe</placeName>, and was at length persuaded, by <lb/>some

                        India <lb/>Company</orgName>’s service. He described the situation of their

                    <lb/>health and comfort so deficient, that no less than one hundred <lb/>and
                    forty men had died on board the ship he served in, during <lb/>the voyage. He

                    <lb/>approached towards them, cracking his long whip, when the old <lb/>dams
                    took up their young, some in their mouths, others on their <lb/>backs, and all
                    scrambled up the steep with astonishing swiftness. <lb/>Some had one young one

                <p><lb/>The shores of <placeName role="visited">the Gowritz river</placeName> are covered with
                    bushes, for <lb/>about two miles in breadth. Many large aloes mixed with, and

                    heard <lb/>laughing, clapping of hands, and other tokens of merriment. Our
                    <lb/>humble knock was often repeated, before it procured us admis<lb break="no"
                    />sion. Now general silence ensued. After giving a proper account <lb/>of
                    ourselves, we requested to know, whether we might have a <lb/>room to sleep in,
                    which was answered in the affirmative, yet with <lb/>hesitation enough to prove,
                    that we were not welcome guests. <lb/>This was also plainly to be traced in the

                    <lb/>On landing, the road was rendered so slippery by the rain, that, with

                        <lb/><persName>Mr. Van Helsland</persName> made me attentive to a singular

                    <lb/>plants and bushes in this country, is disproportionately thick, and
                    <lb/>strikes deep into the ground, like a carrot. A decoction of it is

                    sincere joy <lb/>and gratitude for our safe return, which burst upon us from old
                    and <lb/>young; and we all joined in humble thanks to God, our Saviour <lb/>and
                    Protector, whose mercies unto us during the whole journey, <lb/>had been every

                    tears of <lb/>gratitude to God, for such a visible display of his mercy and
                    power. <lb/>While we were at dinner, a large company of Hottentots assembled
                    <lb/>before the dining-room, and sung a hymn of praise to the Lord, <lb/>for
                    having brought us safe home again. In the usual evening<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>by spreading them on the grass, covering them with sheep’s fat,
                    <lb/>strewing a species of chalk over them, and with a sand-stone, by a
                    <lb/>circular motion of the hand, rubbing them, till the skin becomes as

                    on business. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName>
                    <lb/>addressed him on the diabolical delight he finds, in seducing our

                    be near to his idol, the brandy-cask, and <lb/>seldom sober. He had not a word
                    to say in his own defence, but <lb/>immediately quitted the place.</p>
                <p><lb/>This morning we desired the five Hottentots, who had accom<lb break="no"

                    they should reap the benefit of their labours, <lb/>and be recompensed for their
                    uniform good behaviour, by which <lb/>they did honour to their Christian

                    As they <lb/>had appealed to me, I approved and recommended the measure. <lb/>A

                    the chief part of the stones, used in laying the foundation <lb/>of the new

                    but were obliged to return, for <lb/>want of time. By the way, we called at some
                    Hottentots’ houses, <lb/>and conversed with the inhabitants. In the afternoon,
                    we rode <lb/>to <placeName role="visited">the Sonderend</placeName>, where I made a sketch of

                    and the nature of the com<lb break="no"/>mission, with its responsibilities,
                    explained to them. They de<lb break="no"/>clared themselves willing to accept of
                    it, and several of them <lb/>spoke, with much good sense, of the necessity of
                    providing for the <lb/>maintenance of order in so large a place.

                    and other foreign trees, <lb/>had exhibited a beautiful variety of the richest
                    autumnal tints, <lb/>but to-day, the heavy rain and wind caused a great falling
                    of the <lb/>leaves, and, in a few days more, winter seemed to have assumed
                    <lb/>its reign.</p>
                <p><lb/>This afternoon, a young man, <persName>Francis H.</persName> was brought
                    before <lb/>us, to answer for his having struck another man’s wife. He was
                    <lb/>expected to be very sulky, but confessed the charge, without an
                    <lb/>attempt to defend himself, and heard the sentence of exclusion from
                    <lb/>the meetings of the baptized people, with many tears. He was ap<lb
                        break="no"/>parently not able to speak for grief, and it was with great
                        reluc<lb break="no"/>tance that he retired, when dismissed. On such
                    occasions, I <lb/>generally remained a silent hearer, and found much to approve
                    <lb/>and admire in the manner, in which <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName>
                    administered <lb/>justice. But after <persName>Francis</persName> was gone, I
                    took the liberty to observe, <lb/>that, though he had confessed the charge
                    brought against him, the <lb/>party offended had not been present, to be
                    examined respecting <lb/>the occasion given for the offence, when probably some
                        circum<lb break="no"/>stances might have been discovered, which would have
                    caused the <lb/>sentence to be less rigorous. It is not in the manner of the
                        punish<lb break="no"/>ment, that its severity is felt, so much, as in the
                    effect produced <lb/>in the mind or feelings of the person receiving it. Most of
                    the <lb/>Christian Hottentots, negroes, or other converts from among the
                    <lb/>heathen, in our missionary settlements, would rather endure any
                    <lb/>corporeal chastisement, than be excluded from the meetings of <lb/>their
                    class or division in the congregation. The missionaries, <lb/>acknowledging the
                    truth of these remarks, appointed a second <lb/>hearing in <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father
                        Marsveld</persName>’s room, in presence of two or three of <lb/>their

                    Here again I was <lb/>witness to that great influence, which the missionaries
                    will ever <lb/>possess over the minds of their converts, while the latter are

                    <lb/>and that even the severest reproofs proceed from the sincerest <lb/>regard
                    for their welfare. We now obtained a true account of the <lb/>transaction,
                    which, though in itself of small consequence, I relate, <lb/>as an instance of
                    the manner, in which affairs of this nature are <lb/>treated in our
                    settlements.</p>
                <p><lb/>By a rule long established, every inhabitant is bound to make <lb/>good the
                    damage done by his cattle in his neighbour’s grounds. <lb/>To prevent such
                    mischief, they are continually exhorted to keep <lb/>their hedges and other
                    fences in repair; the neglect of which ope<lb break="no"/>rates against the
                    complainant in awarding damages. The husband <lb/>of this woman had suffered his
                    horse to enter <rs type="place" role="mentioned"><persName>Francis</persName>’s garden</rs>, and
                    <lb/>do considerable mischief. <persName>Francis</persName> complained, and the
                    man <lb/>agreed, that, to compensate for the damage done, he should have
                    <lb/>twenty or thirty cabbages, with which he was satisfied. On com<lb
                        break="no"/>ing to claim them, he found the best of them cut off and carried
                    <lb/>away. He entered the house, and found only the wife at home, <lb/>who
                    answered to his remonstrance, in a manner so affronting, that <lb/>he gave the
                    woman a push, not a blow, according to her own <lb/>admission, when some high
                    words passed between them. On <lb/><sic>cros</sic>-examination, the woman
                    confessed, that, hearing the bargain <lb/>made between her husband and
                        <persName>Francis</persName>, she had thought it no <lb/>harm, to save as
                    much of her husband’s property as she could, and <lb/>therefore secured the best
                    cabbages. The injustice of such de<lb break="no"/>ceitful conduct being
                    represented to her, and that she deserved to <lb/>be excluded, as well as
                        <persName>Francis</persName>, she seemed terrified, and offered <lb/>to make
                    any reparation in her power. They were then, after some <lb/>further
                    exhortation, asked, whether they could heartily forgive <lb/>each other. This
                    they did with great sincerity, shaking hands, <lb/>promising never more to
                    remember the offence given. The sen<lb break="no"/>tence, passed on

                    <lb/>Holy Sacrament was administered to about three hundred and fifty

                    <lb/>When I entered and took my seat, and beheld the congregation <lb/>sitting
                    before me, in silent expectation of that great blessing, <lb/>which attends the
                    celebration of this sacramental feast, instituted <lb/>by our Lord himself, in
                    remembrance of His sufferings and death, <lb/>I felt quite overwhelmed, and
                    almost totally lost in contempla<lb break="no"/>tion. Nor were my feelings free
                    from pain, when I reflected, <lb/>that, in a few days, I must leave this place
                    and people, duty re<lb break="no"/>quiring, that I should not much longer
                    indulge in the delight my <lb/>abode at <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> had

                    where I had more business to transact, than at <lb/>this place.</p>
                <p><lb/>I could not help drawing a comparison between the condition <lb/>of these
                    Hottentots, and that of the poor, squalid, and ignorant <lb/>wretches I had
                    seen, during my late journey. And these had <lb/>been in the same state, but for
                    the preaching of the Gospel. If <lb/>this be not a miracle, wrought by the power
                    of God alone, I know <lb/>not what is!</p>
                <p><lb/>Effects so striking may prove to all men, that it is not by enticing

                    />ces, but by the preaching of the cross of Christ, in demonstration of <lb/>the
                    Spirit, that the heart of man is changed, and he is made a new <lb/>creature.
                    And, as I humbly hope, that, through the mercy of God, <lb/>I have been taught
                    to believe in Jesus, as my only trust and refuge <lb/>in life and death, my
                    faith was greatly strengthened, and my mind <lb/>filled anew with assurance,
                    that we are doing right, in determining <lb/>“to know nothing amongst men, save
                    Christ Jesus and Him cruci<lb break="no"/>“fied.” Yet I do not wonder, that some
                    good men reprove us <lb/>for dwelling too much on this subject. Its effects are

                    alone can <lb/>justify the practice, as consistent with the will and wisdom of

                    the usual service was performed <lb/>at <rs type="place" role="visited">the church</rs>. In the afternoon, two

                <p><lb/>After this solemnity, the chapel-servants came in a body to pay <lb/>me a

                    Hottentots, that they are, in general, <lb/>more sensible, and possess better
                    judgment, than most Europeans <lb/>equally destitute of the means of

                    rather to beg me not to leave them. <lb/>Some said: “You seem so much at home

                    reporting to my Brethren, <lb/>what I had here seen and heard of the effects of

                    those of <lb/>their nation, who were yet in darkness. When they perceived, that
                    <lb/>nothing would prevail to detain me, many shed tears, saying, that <lb/>as

                    before <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName> and three other <lb/>Brethren, to be

                        <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>. This was a new case, which involved a
                    difficult <lb/>question.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Philip</persName> had formerly belonged to the congregation, and,
                    for some <lb/>time after his baptism, conducted himself with propriety. His

                    scene of <lb/>confusion and uproar. Added to this, they both began to indulge
                    <lb/>in liquor, and exhortations being fruitless, he was ordered to quit
                    <lb/>the settlement. His first expulsion seemed to produce within him, <fw

                    <lb/>time into the same transgression, he refused to depart, and became <lb/>a
                    terror to the peaceable inhabitants. The missionaries had now <lb/>no means of
                    ridding themselves of such disturbers of the public <lb/>peace, but by an
                    application to <rs type="person">the landdrost</rs>. That magistrate <lb/>was very
                    ready to lend his aid, and ordered <persName>Philip</persName> instantly <lb/>to
                    leave <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>, and not to enter the settlement within
                    a <lb/>twelvemonth, on pain of imprisonment. But this was not the in<lb
                        break="no"/>tention of the missionaries and their congregation, who dreaded
                    his <lb/>return. Whenever the subject occurred in conversation, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father
                        <lb/>Marsveld</persName>, knowing the character of the man, assured us, that
                    on <lb/>the very day, on which the year of his banishment was completed, <lb/>he
                    would make his appearance; which he did accordingly, furnish<lb break="no"/>ed
                    with a handsome testimonial from the farmer, by whom he had <lb/>been
                    employed.</p>
                <p><lb/>Though I had heard much to his disadvantage, I could not help <lb/>admiring
                    the address of this Hottentot. He was a man of supe<lb break="no"/>rior
                    intellect, great bodily strength, six feet high, and had an im<lb break="no"

                        repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the wicked conduct both of himself and his

                    hurtful to the <lb/>youth in the congregation, annoying in the extreme to all
                    the inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, he made a reply, full of confession and
                    contrition, not pre<lb break="no"/>tending to defend himself, but only craving
                    mercy, patience, and <lb/>another trial, with so much eloquence, that to us, who
                    were novices <lb/>in these things, he appeared truly sincere, and deserving of
                    attention. <lb/>We were rather surprised to hear <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father

                    over with <persName>Philip</persName>, whose countenance showed the deepest
                        con<lb break="no"/>viction and humility. But I was mistaken. He granted
                    every <lb/>word the venerable missionary had spoken, to be true, and that he
                    <lb/>deserved to be suspected of falsehood and pretence, but proceeded <lb/>to
                    make such protestations of his sincerity, and the remorse he felt, <lb/>on
                    account of his former trangressions, that <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Father Marsveld</persName>,
                        per<lb break="no"/>ceiving by our looks, that we were disposed to relent,
                    ordered <lb/><persName>Philip</persName> to withdraw, that we might consult
                    together in private. <lb/>He then observed, that he did not wonder at our being
                    moved by <lb/>the Hottentot’s speech, since we were yet unacquainted with that
                    <lb/>particular character, but that, if a real change was wrought in the
                    <lb/>man’s heart, it would appear to him one of the greatest miracles he
                    <lb/>had ever heard of, or seen. The result was, that
                        <persName>Philip</persName> was per<lb break="no"/>mitted to stay till <date

                    <lb/>decision. Meanwhile, the opzieners were convened, and the case <lb/>laid
                    before them. The missionaries supposed, that they would un<lb break="no"

                    </choice>, <lb/>they all pleaded for a third trial. We afterwards discovered,
                    that <lb/><persName>Philip</persName> had informed himself of their appointment,
                    and waited <lb/>upon each, when, by his penitential declarations, he had quieted

                    that they might in <lb/>future avoid giving such offence to a Christian people,
                    and such <lb/>pain to their teachers. She seemed to relent, and promised obe<lb

                        obtain<lb break="no"/>ed leave to erect a hut, and cultivate some

                    they would be expelled by <rs type="person">the land<lb break="no"/>drost</rs>, never more to return.
                    As long as I remained in <placeName role="mentioned">Africa</placeName>, no <lb/>complaint was
                    made against them, nor have I heard any since my <lb/>return, and we may hope,
                    that the professions of <persName>Philip Appell</persName>
                    <lb/>have been sincere, and, by the grace of God, evinced their reali<lb

                <p><lb/>On this occasion, I could not but again notice that easy flow of <lb/>speech

                    Hottentot, even without genuine conversion of heart, <lb/>appear qualified to

                    where formerly that <lb/>tribe had its residence. That, also, the first

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-06-07">7th.</date> I visited <rs type="place" role="visited">the girls’ school</rs>, and
                    heard some of them read very <lb/>well. <persName>Dr. Bell</persName>’s plan is
                    followed as much as possible, but not in <lb/>all its parts. Some have made
                    tolerable progress in writing.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the afternoon, I rode with <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123420358">Brother Lemmerz</persName>, across
                        <placeName role="visited">the <lb/>Sonderend</placeName>, to a hill beyond
                            <rs type="place" role="visited_nearby"><persName>Badenhorst</persName>’s farm</rs>; where I
                    made a <lb/>drawing of the approach to the <placeName role="visited">Gnadenthal
                        valley</placeName>. The river <lb/>was so much swollen, that it was
                    impossible to ford it, without <lb/>being wet.</p>
                <p><lb/>As the time of my departure drew near, the farewell-visits of the
                    <lb/>Hottentots became more frequent, and many parties of men, women, <lb/>and
                    children, followed each other during the day.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the evening, <persName>captain Koopman</persName> and two other
                    Hottentots <lb/>paid me a formal visit. They began the conversation, by
                        express<lb break="no"/>ing the regard and affection they felt for me, and
                    their sorrow for <lb/>my departure. Having made portraits of the two venerable
                    Fa<lb break="no"/>thers, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117949352">Marsveld</persName> and
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122701083">Schwinn</persName>, which lay on my table, they immedi<lb
                        break="no"/>ately knew them, and seemed delighted to see them “written down
                    <lb/>on paper.” <persName>Captain Koopman</persName> then said, that he had
                    still some<lb break="no"/>thing to observe about the land belonging to the
                    Hottentots, in <lb/>consequence of my having lately asserted, “that the land was
                    given <lb/>by <orgName>Government</orgName> to <hi rend="i">the Brethren</hi>,
                    for the Hottentots, and that, if it <lb/>had not been for the Mission, the
                    Hottentots would have lost it all.” <lb/>He entered into a long demonstration to
                    prove, that not only this <lb/>land, but two neighbouring farms, which he named,
                    had, in old <lb/>times, been Hottentots’ land, being secured to one of his
                    ancestors, <lb/>by some Dutch Governor, but to which ancestor, and by what <pb

                    <lb/>Governor, he could not tell. He added, that there was now not <lb/>land
                    enough for pasture, and that if, according to my recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion,
                    still more were to be brought under tillage for fields and gar<lb break="no"
                    />dens, they must keep fewer cattle, and that, if those spots, which
                    <lb/>appeared fit for the rearing of corn, were ploughed and sown, they
                    <lb/>would be surrounded by pasture-ground, and the produce trodden <lb/>down by
                    beasts.</p>
                <p><lb/>He therefore wished me to apply to <orgName>the English
                    Government</orgName>, to <lb/>restore to the Hottentots the two farms in
                    question. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456495">Brother Leit<lb break="no"/>ner</persName> being
                    interpreter, I explained to him, that <orgName>the English Govern<lb break="no"
                        />ment</orgName> must and would act justly; that they had already greatly
                    fa<lb break="no"/>voured the Christian Hottentots; that what I said about
                    the land <lb/>being given “to the Brethren,” for the Hottentots, was strictly
                    <lb/>true, for they had the right granted them of giving it to, or with<lb
                        break="no"/>holding it from, any Hottentot, at their discretion; and that
                    the <lb/>occupation of it by the Brethren, as landlords, was the only sure
                    <lb/>way of preserving it for the use of the Hottentots; for he must know,
                    <lb/>that but for <orgName>the English Government</orgName>, not only the two farms he
                    <lb/>mentioned, but <placeName role="mentioned">Bavians-kloof</placeName> itself, would have been
                    seized upon <lb/>by some white landholder. Moreover, that <orgName>the English
                            Govern<lb break="no"/>ment</orgName> could not in justice dispossess the
                    farmers of their property, <lb/>unless by purchase, which could not be expected.
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123456495">Brother Leitner</persName>
                    <lb/>then showed, that the Brethren had spent above a thousand rix<lb break="no"
                        type="hyphenated"/>dollars, in securing land for the Hottentots, and could
                    do no more, <lb/>since they received no interest or benefit whatever from
                    it.</p>
                <p><lb/>With these explanations they appeared quite satisfied, but added <lb/>some
                    very sensible remarks on the present degraded state of their <lb/>countrymen,
                    who lived with the boors, since all the country had been <lb/>taken from them,
                    and was possessed by intruders, I endeavoured <lb/>to make them understand,
                    “that though I by no means meant to <lb/>justify such encroachment and robbery,
                    yet they might, as Christ<lb break="no"/>ian people, find some consolation in
                    the reflection, that, had it not <lb/>been for the occupation of their country

                    misery <lb/>both here and hereafter. We then explained to them the state of
                    <lb/>the negroes in the <placeName role="mentioned">West Indies</placeName>, who had not only
                    lost their land and <lb/>liberty, but were carried as slaves into a foreign
                    country; and yet <lb/>many of those, who had received the gospel, now rejoiced
                    in that, <lb/>which, to man, seemed the greatest misfortune, because it had been
                    <lb/>the means of preparing them, by faith in Jesus, for the possession <lb/>of
                    an inheritance incorruptible and eternal.” They heard us with <lb/>great
                    attention, and, during the latter part of the address, tears filled <lb/>their
                    eyes, and they declared their thankfulness to God for their <lb/>present
                    privileges; adding, that in conversation among themselves, <lb/>they frequently
                    reminded each other of these benefits.</p>
                <p><lb/>It was to me a most interesting discovery, showing, that these <lb/>poor
                    people likewise reason about the rights of man, though with <lb/>rather more
                    coolness and good sense, than some among our English <lb/>demagogues have
                    done.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-06-08">8th.</date> To-day I was much engaged in making
                    preparations for my <lb/>departure, and finished a farewell-address to the

                    and once more commended me and my <lb/><sic>fel low</sic> travellers to the

                    would press forward, and their eagerness once more <lb/>to shake hands and bid
                    me farewell, was so great, that a general <lb/>scramble was avoided only by my

                    and entered the waggon, when they began, with one voice, <lb/>tosing their
                    farewell-hymn.</p>
                <p><lb/>At this moment, I felt all resistance to my feelings give way. <lb/>Never
                    have I experienced a keener pang, on leaving any place, or <lb/>any friends, to
                    whom I was attached. <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName> is indeed a spot,
                    <lb/>where I have found myself so much at home, and where almost <lb/>every
                    object conspired to fill my mind with grateful remembrances <lb/>and
                    contemplations, that, though convinced of my duty to proceed <lb/>to
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName>, where business of importance to that
                    settlement <lb/>demanded my presence, I found it necessary to do violence
                    <lb/>to my feelings, to tear myself loose. But my spirit will often <lb/>dwell
                    in those hallowed groves, accompany the congregation into <lb/>the house of
                    prayer, attend them during their truly solemn assem<lb break="no"/>blies, behold
                    with affection and delight the pious labours of their <lb/>teachers, participate
                    in their joys, their sorrows, and their cares, <lb/>and enjoy an aftertaste of
                    the heavenly comfort attending the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the holy
                    sacraments, by the presence and power of <lb/>our Lord and Saviour.</p>
                <p><lb/>The whole missionary family, and about a hundred and fifty <lb/>Hottentots,
                    small and great, on foot or on horseback, accompanied <lb/>us beyond

                    dinner was preparing, we walked with <lb/>our landlord into his grounds. He had

                    other im<lb break="no"/>provements, by which, if he succeeds, his place will

                <p><lb/><placeName role="visited">The Great Haue Hoek</placeName> presents itself here, with many
                    small <lb/>peaks. Its rocks are the habitations of baboons, which, indeed,
                    <lb/>occupy the summits of all the neighbouring hills. <persName>Mr.

                    party from the opposite range. <lb/>It was maintained on both sides with great
                    fury, and with horrid <lb/>yells and barkings, when, suddenly, a stop was put to
                    it, by an <lb/>unfortunate jackal running in among them. The poor animal
                    <lb/>was seized by one party and thrown towards the other, then back <lb/>again.
                    His cries, added to those of the combatants, filled the air <lb/>with the most
                    discordant sounds, till the death uf the intruder <lb/>seemed to give the signal
                    for a general retreat.</p>
                <p><lb/>Hearing that the ford of <placeName role="mentioned">the Palmite Revier</placeName> was
                    impassable, <lb/>we drove to the bridge. At the <rs type="place" role="visited">toll-house</rs> we found a miserable

                    It rests upon stone piers, <lb/>thought sufficiently strong to resist the force
                    of the stream, which <lb/>sometimes, in the rainy season, becomes extremely
                    rapid and <lb/>fierce, but was now nearly hid among palmite-plants and low
                    <lb/>bushes, growing in its bed. To prevent the wood-work from be<lb break="no"

                    them by strong chains, on the side of the water’s descent. The <lb/>bridge is
                    furnished with railings, and on the floor-planks, the <lb/>thick spungy stalks

                    <lb/>partly to afford an easier passage for the bullock’s feet, and partly

                    both they and their dogs seemed much alarmed at our <lb/>early approach. The

                    region. At the top of the western descent, I noticed a vein <lb/>of iron-stone,
                    with sand-stone and indurated clay, of a reddish or <lb/>violet colour, which

                    However, after the first expressions of displeasure had <lb/>passed by, he
                    behaved towards us with the greatest civility, and <lb/>hospitality. His house

                        Sebastian <lb/>Van Rhenen</persName>, where we dined. This gentleman has
                    been a friend <lb/>to the <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName> Mission from its
                    beginning. Having for<lb break="no"/>merly travelled all over the colony, he
                    gave us some interesting <lb/>information on several topics, but particularly on
                    the state of <lb/>agriculture, in the colony. His remarks, founded on long

                    me, some extraordinary music <lb/>was to be performed, to solemnize the
                    commemoration of the deli<lb break="no"/>very of the <placeName role="mentioned">Augsburg</placeName> Confession, I
                    expected some ecclesiastical <lb/>anthem in the good old Lutheran style, but was
                    sadly disap<lb break="no"/>pointed. By way of a prelude, the organist, a very
                    clever perfor<lb break="no"/>mer both on the piano-forte and violin, assisted by
                    about six or <lb/>eight of the military band, treated us with the middle
                    movement <lb/>of <persName>Haydn</persName>’s military symphony. The performance
                    of this mar<lb break="no"/>tial piece was surely a very improper preparation for
                    religious <lb/>worship. On <persName>Mr. Hesse</persName>’s entering the church,
                    and stepping <lb/>before the altar, he pronounced the words; “Holy is God!
                    <lb/>Holy is God! the Lord of Sabaoth!” Between each sentence, a <lb/>choir,
                    consisting of four or five men, sung the same words to <lb/>music, pretending to
                    be the <hi rend="i">Sanctus</hi> in <persName>Haydn</persName>’s first mass, but
                    <lb/>strangely altered and mangled. The singers had no copies written <lb/>out
                    for their use, but, turning their backs to the congregation, <pb n="300"/>

                    </fw>
                    <lb/>looked over the organist’s shoulder’s into his book. The majestic
                    <lb/>simplicity of the Lutheran hymn-tunes was lost, in a display of the
                    <lb/>most flourishing decorations. Still I hoped, that, during some part <lb/>of
                    the service, which, as far as the preacher and congregation were <lb/>concerned,
                    was conducted with great solemnity, some anthem would <lb/>be performed. I was
                    mistaken; for, as a prelude to one of the four <lb/>hymns appointed for the
                    occasion, we were treated with another <lb/>instrumental piece of
                        <persName>Haydn</persName>, beautiful in its composition, and well
                    <lb/>executed by the band, but rather suited to accompany a dance, <lb/>than to
                    excite devotional feelings. Of <persName>Mr. Hesse</persName>’s most impressive
                    <lb/>discourse, I understood more, than on a former occasion, having <lb/>seated
                    myself near the pulpit. He closed it with a serious, and in<lb break="no"/>deed
                    mournful, consideration of the great degeneracy, now prevail<lb break="no"/>ing
                    throughout the Protestant communion, and with an earnest, <lb/>but affectionate
                    address to his congregation, and especially to the <lb/>youth, exhorting them to
                    consider their ways, and return unto the <lb/>Lord, who had granted them such
                    great privileges, and the free use <lb/>of His Holy Word and Sacraments. But, as
                    if to efface all due im<lb break="no"/>pression made upon the audience, by the
                    solemnity of <persName>Mr. Hesse</persName>’s <lb/>discourse, the organist
                    struck up the last movement of the military <lb/>symphony, which half the
                    congregation staid to hear.</p>
                <p><lb/>I must confess, that I left the church with pain and disgust. <lb/>Though
                    blame may attach to the persons engaged in this degrada<lb break="no"/>tion of
                    the service, and of that noble art, which is so suitably and <lb/>acceptably
                    employed to promote devotion, when under the influence <lb/>of a proper spirit,
                    yet the cause of grief and regret in the heart of <lb/>every sincere Christian,
                    on account of such incongruities, lies deeper. <lb/>That such things exist, is
                    one convincing proof, among many, of the <lb/>truth of the reverend preacher’s
                    description of the present degene<lb break="no"/>racy. In those days, when the
                    Protestant Confession was presented <lb/>at <placeName role="mentioned">Augsburg</placeName>, would such performances
                    have been borne in a place <lb/>of worship?</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Luther</persName> knew the value of music, and the strong influence it has <lb/>upon

                    <lb/>use of it in the Church. He increased the number of hymns, <lb/>and by
                    these means caused the knowledge of evangelical truth <lb/>to spread fast among
                    the people. Nor did he object to those <lb/>antiphonal and choral performances,
                    which accompanied both the <lb/>Jewish and the primitive Christian worship, and
                    furnish an agree<lb break="no"/>able variety and relief. But it was never the
                    design of this great <lb/>reformer, that the church should be the theatre, upon
                    which music<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>masters and singers might exhibit
                    the swiftness of their fingers, or <lb/>the powers of their voice. There are
                    other opportunities and places, <lb/>where this may be done with propriety, and
                    give delight to the <lb/>most religious scientific admirer of the art. But in
                    the house of <lb/>prayer, these exhibitions are out of place, and the skill and
                    taste <lb/>of the performer should rather be discovered, by his knowing how
                    <lb/>to give majesty and effect to simplicity, without drawing the atten<lb

                    admiration <lb/>of himself. Instrumental music speaks a language, and expresses
                    <lb/>affections, as well as vocal. This is understood but imperfectly; <lb/>yet
                    there are few, who will not grant, that a march or a jig, per<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>brought out of the trap. The skin was beautifully variegated <lb/>with
                    stripes and spots. The ground-colour a blueish grey, the <lb/>spots black, with
                    some admixture of brown. It is a species of <lb/>viverra, with a long snout, and
                    very sharp fangs. That, now <lb/>caught, measured a foot and a half from its

                <p><lb/>On the <date when-iso="1816-07-07">7th</date>, I received a letter from
                        <persName>Mr. Hancke</persName>, informing me, <lb/>that in consequence of
                    my having desired a passage to <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName> to <lb/>be secured
                    for me, on board the first homeward-bound ship, he had <lb/>provisionally done
                    it in the Francis and Eliza, which would sail in <lb/>a few days; yet subject to
                    my own decision. The notice being so <lb/>short, I was brought into some
                    dilemma, but resolved to go to <lb/><placeName role="mentioned">Capetown</placeName>, and make
                    further inquiry. In the night, I was seized <lb/>with headach, and felt too
                    unwell, to think of setting off in the <lb/>morning.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-07-08">8th.</date> My indisposition confined me to the
                    room, both this and <lb/>the following day. The weather likewise became
                    unfavourable, and <lb/>the rainy season seemed to set in with violence.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-07-10">10th.</date> Instead, therefore, of going, I
                    sent a messenger to <placeName role="mentioned">the Cape</placeName>, <lb/>and declined the offer
                    of a passage on board the above-mentioned <lb/>vessel. Nor had I finished all I
                    had yet to do at <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName>. I <lb/>had afterwards
                    reason to believe, that it was providential, that <lb/>I was detained.</p>

                    loosely thrown together, affording shelter <lb/>to baboons, wolves, and jackals.
                    But these animals are seldom <lb/>seen, without going into their haunts. They
                    prove their presence <lb/>in the country, by their frequent depredations and

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-07-12">12th.</date> We walked through the wood with

                    might be marked. He also <lb/>pointed out a mode of constructing Hottentot
                    houses in a more <lb/>expeditious, convenient, and durable manner, than is done
                    at pre<lb break="no"/>sent; and offered to come with a slave, and help to build

                    opinions formed from appearances are <lb/>fallacious! Nothing, surely, would

                    an old Hottentot station, <lb/>in a pleasant, fruitful valley, with a supply of
                    water from a foun<lb break="no"/>tain, but now only used for pasture. A

                    appearing like a heathy <lb/>and desolate plain, with a few scattered farms. The

                    the patience of my readers, if I repeat it here, as related <lb/>to me by

                <p><lb/>Wolves having done much mischief at <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName>,
                    where they <lb/>even entered the yard and took away a sheep, and in the fields
                    <lb/>worried several beasts belonging to the Hottentots, an attempt was
                    <lb/>made, on the <date when-iso="1815-08-06">6th of August</date>, to find out
                    their haunts, and, if possi<lb break="no"/>ble, to destroy them. For that
                    purpose, the missionaries <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115345946">Bonatz</persName>
                    <lb/>and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Schmitt</persName>, with about thirty Hottentots, set out
                    early in the <lb/>morning, towards the <placeName role="mentioned">Lauweskloof hill</placeName>,
                    where they are mostly met <lb/>with. One of these animals was seen and lamed by
                    a shot, but es<lb break="no"/>caped and entered the bushes. The Hottentots
                    followed, but the <lb/>missionaries, not expecting to succeed, were returning,
                    when the <lb/>party called to them, that the wounded wolf was in the thicket.
                    <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> rode back, and alighting, entered

                    <persName>Philip</persName>, began to <lb/>retreat backwards, pointing his gun,
                    and ready to fire, in case the <lb/>animal made his appearance. Suddenly a tyger
                    sprang forward, <lb/>but from a quarter not expected, and by a flying leap over
                    the <lb/>bushes, fastened upon the Hottentot, seizing his nose and face with
                    <lb/>claws and teeth. I measured the distance of the place, from whence <lb/>the
                    tyger made his spring, to that on which the Hottentot stood, and <lb/>found it
                    full twenty feet, over bushes from six to eight feet high.
                    <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> observed, that if it had not been
                    for the horror of <lb/>the scene, it would have been a most amusing sight, to
                    behold the <lb/>enraged creature fly, like a bird, over that length of ground
                    and <lb/>bushes, with open jaw and lashing tail, screaming with the greatest
                    <lb/>violence. Poor <persName>Philip</persName> was thrown down, and in the
                    conflict lay <lb/>now upon, and then under, the tyger. The missionary might
                    easily <lb/>have effected his escape, but his own safety never entered his
                    <lb/>thoughts. Duty and pity made him instantly run forward to the
                    <lb/>assistance of the sufferer. He pointed his gun, but the motions <lb/>of
                    both the Hottentot and the tyger, in rolling about and strug<lb break="no"

                        Schmitt</persName>. As the gun <lb/>was of no use in such close quarters, he
                    let it fall, and presented <lb/>his left arm, to shield his face. The tyger
                    instantly seized it with <lb/>his jaw, <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> with
                    the same arm catching one of his <lb/>paws, to prevent his outstretched claws
                    from reaching his body. <lb/>With the other paw, however, the tyger continued
                    striking towards <lb/>his breast, and tearing his clothes. Both fell in the
                    scuffle, and <lb/>providentially, in such a position, that the missionary’s
                    knee, without <lb/>design, came to rest on the pit of the tyger’s stomach. At

                    <lb/>tyger’s, whose open mouth, from the pressure of his wind-pipe, sent
                    <lb/>forth the most hideous, hoarse, and convulsive groans, while his
                    <lb/>starting eyes, like live coals, seemed to flash with fire.</p>
                <p><lb/>In this situation. <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> called aloud to the
                        Hotten<lb break="no"/>tots, to come to his rescue, for his strength was fast
                    failing, rage <lb/>and agony supplying to the animal extraordinary force, in his
                        at<lb break="no"/>tempts to disengage himself. The Hottentots at length
                    ventured <lb/>to enter the thicket, and one of them, snatching the loaded gun,
                    <lb/>which lay on the ground, presented it and shot the tyger, under <lb/>the
                    missionary’s hand, right through the heart. His death was in<lb break="no"
                    />stantaneous, his eyes shut, his jaw fell, and he lay motionless. Had <lb/>any
                    life been left, his dying struggles might yet have proved fatal <lb/>to some of
                    his assailants.</p>
                <p><lb/>Then first <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName> began to feel the extent of
                    the injury <lb/>done to his arm, but his chief concern was to know, how poor
                            <persName>Phi<lb break="no"/>lip</persName> had fared. He found, that he
                    had exerted himself to rise and <lb/>help his teacher; but his face being
                    terribly lacerated, and his eyes <lb/>filled with blood, he could not render any
                    assistance. Horses be<lb break="no"/>ing provided, they were both brought
                    home.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123495062">Sister Schmitt</persName> instantly dispatched a messenger to

                    Meanwhile, the Brethren had done all in their <lb/>power to aford relief, but
                    without success. The fever and inflam<lb break="no"/>mation increased daily. The
                    patient grew delirious, and told me, <lb/>that in his delirium, nothing appeared
                    so dreadful to him, as the pic<lb break="no"/>ture of the tyger’s open jaws and
                    fiery eyes, presented to his disordered <lb/>imagination. He thought himself
                    still in that position. On the ar<lb break="no"/>rival of <persName>Dr.
                        Cairns</persName>, every possible means were used to bring down <lb/>the
                    inflammation. There were seven deep wounds in the arm. In <lb/>two or three
                    places, the tyger’s fangs had penetrated into the bone. <lb/>For several weeks,
                    the life of this valuable man was in the greatest <lb/>danger, but by God’s
                    blessing on the unwearied exertions of <persName>Dr. <lb/>Cairns</persName>, and
                    the excellent nursing of <rs type="person">his faithful wife</rs>, he recovered.</p>

                <p><lb/>Here we were accosted by an old woman, the most ugly and de<lb break="no"

                    life, by which, she had brought misery and ugliness upon <lb/>herself. She
                    called God to witness, that the stories told and be<lb break="no"/>lieved,
                    respecting her wicked life, were totally false, and used such <lb/>language,

                    <lb/>of a man of consequence. To see this poor blind man, groping his <lb/>way
                    out of his dark abode to bid us welcome, was a truly pitiable <lb/>sight. Still
                    more blind as to those things, which are of most im<lb break="no"/>portance to
                    the soul, he now paid no attention to <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother Schmitt</persName>’s
                    <lb/>friendly invitation to come to <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName>. The
                    missionary re<lb break="no"/>minded him of <rs type="person">his daughter</rs>’s baptism, and the hopes
                    then enter<lb break="no"/>tained by us all, that he would follow her example,
                    and in his old <lb/>age, turn to the Lord. He excused himself with a lameness in
                    his <lb/>back, but all good impression, made upon him at that time, seemed
                    <lb/>to have vanished. Yet he expressed himself pleased and thankful <lb/>for
                    our visit.</p>
                <p><lb/>Earth-hogs had made approaches towards his hut, which they <lb/>seemed
                    disposed to undermine. Several of their holes were not far <lb/>off, and being
                    aware of the danger, he made some inquiry about <lb/>them. We advised him,
                    either to get his people to destroy them, <lb/>or to remove his hut, as
                    otherwise, before he was aware, he and the <lb/>old woman that attended him,
                    might be suddenly let down alive <lb/>into their sepulchral caverns.</p>
                <p><lb/>These singular creatures are about as large as a common pig. <lb/>They have
                    a long snout, long sharp claws, very little hair, and a <lb/>rough skin. Their
                    food is the ants, and probably other insects. <lb/>The ants carry their nests
                    under ground, sometimes to a depth of <lb/>from five to eight and more feet. The
                    earth-hogs therefore follow <lb/>them, and, putting in their long tongue, draw
                    them out and devour <lb/>them. The holes made by these creatures, are often hid
                    among <lb/>the bushes, and a huntsman crossing the waste, may meet with <lb/>an
                    unexpected overthrow, either by falling into them, or by the <lb/>earth being
                    undermined near the entrance, giving way under the <lb/>horse’s feet.</p>
                <p><lb/>During this ride, I was likewise made attentive to a bird, impro<lb
                        break="no"/>perly called a lark. It is about the size of a lark, flies up
                    with a <lb/>rustling noise, rises to a moderate height, and lying on its wings,
                    <lb/>descends, uttering a mournful whoop or whistle. Its melancholy <pb n="311"/>

                    to <lb/>rain, they are often seen crawling from one bush to another across
                    <lb/>the road. Observing to my Hottentot, that they were the best <lb/>protected
                    of all the innoxious animals of this howling wilderness,<lb/> he was of a
                    different opinion. The jackals, he replied, watch for <lb/>the young tortoises,
                    crack their tender shell as easily as a nut, and <lb/>devour them: again, the
                    crows attack the larger ones, as they are <lb/>passing over a place, unprotected
                    by bushes, turn them over, <lb/>and by inserting their long bills into the open
                    parts of the shell, <lb/>sieze their feet and heads, and most dexterously
                    contrive, by <lb/>degrees, to pick out the whole animal. Of that most venomous
                    <lb/>reptile, the puffader, he gave me several strange accounts, hardly to
                    <lb/>be credited. It is said, that the production of the young brood is <lb/>the

                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Hesse</persName> walking with me, we entered into much

                    <lb/>there existed some material difference, as to our views of certain

                    and his party, had shot a hundred <lb/>and six antelopes. This led once more to

                    being a good marksman. But is not this disposition in <lb/>mankind owing to a

                <p><lb/>Since the English have been here, the great consumption of <lb/>grain had

                    the rocks being only between one and two <lb/>feet in thickness. Trees,
                    therefore, will not thrive, but the situa<lb break="no"/>tion is well studded

                    here <lb/>insist upon it, that this schistus is the ground-work of all these

                    />nences, about two or three miles north of the settlement. Upon <lb/>the first,
                    a curious assemblage of large blocks of granite form a <lb/>mass of a singular
                    kind; some, of a pyramidal form, stand up<lb break="no"/>right, others lie
                    horizontally. The interstices between them are <lb/>filled with many kinds of
                    bushes, and a variety of plants, inte<lb break="no"/>resting to a botanist. The
                    second is called <placeName role="visited">the Baviansberg</placeName>, be<lb break="no"
                    />longing to the <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName> estate. Its summit is
                    likewise co<lb break="no"/>vered with rocks and masses of granite, among high
                    bushes. I <lb/>was made particularly attentive to the great quantity of olive<lb

                    stems six or eight <lb/>inches in diameter, and rise to twelve or more feet in
                    height. A <lb/>variety of the speckboom attracted my notice. The stem and
                    <lb/>boughs are easily broken, having hardly the consistency of a car<lb

                    two <lb/>inches by one in surface. The whole upper part of the hill or

                    with a wilder<lb break="no"/>ness of every kind of bush and shrub, common to
                    this country, <lb/>forming an almost impenetrable thicket. In endeavouring to

                    found resistance made to our progress by thorny plants of <lb/>various kinds,
                    particularly by one, called <hi rend="i">Wach en beetgen</hi>, or <lb/>“Stop a

                    patience is required to extricate oneself from its <lb/>barbed hold. Some thorns
                    lie low enough to tear away shoe-strings <lb/>or knee-bands, and others
                    penetrate the skin. We were glad, af<lb break="no"/>ter much trouble, to get

                    thus exposed, during the night becomes the prey of birds or <lb/>field-mice,
                    which they patiently suffer. When I represented to <lb/>them the injury they
                    sustained, they insisted upon it, that it <lb/>must be so done in this country,
                    and endeavoured to explain <lb/>the reason, which I must confess myself too dull

                <p><lb/>The harrow they use, is a triangular frame, formed of three <lb/>pieces of

                <p><lb/>I observed in that part of the waste, over which I walked to<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>He was in better health and spirits. I had caught a violent cold, <lb/>and
                    felt unwell. But a packet of letters from <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName> made me

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-08-05">5th.</date> In the afternoon, visiting some
                    Hottentot families, I observed <lb/>an unfinished house, the walls of stone, and
                    well built, and inquired <lb/>into the reason of its being left in that state,
                    when I found, that it <lb/>was owing to a want of wood for the doors, roof, and
                    furniture. <lb/>This led to an explanation respecting the possession of the
                    wood, <lb/>and prevented the poor people appealing to <rs type="person">the
                        landdrost</rs> against <lb/>the overseer, who had very properly
                    prohibited their cutting wood <lb/>at their pleasure, by which, formerly, a
                    great many trees have been <lb/>destroyed. Till better instructed, the
                    Hottentots have no thought <lb/>beyond the present moment, and being too lazy to
                    stoop and apply <lb/>their axe to the bottom of the stem, they chop it off as
                    high as they <lb/>can stand to it, besides maiming others by cutting off their
                    branches, <lb/>or tops, without any attention to the growth of the tree. The
                        ge<lb break="no"/>neral scarcity of wood makes it therefore highly necessary
                    to pre<lb break="no"/>vent such mischief, and as they may have what wood they
                    want, <lb/>to build their huts, if they only apply to <rs type="person">the overseer</rs>, there is no
                    <lb/>hardship in their asking for it. They were satisfied, when
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother <lb/>Schmitt</persName> explained the matter to them.</p>
                <p><lb/>In the evening, the family met to a consultation respecting the
                    <lb/>commencement of the building of the new church, and the means <lb/>of
                    providing food and dwelling for any additional hands.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-08-06">6th.</date> To-day we began to carry stones from
                    the rocks behind the <lb/>stables, to lay the foundation of the church, and I
                    was much pleased <lb/>to see the zeal and spirit, with which the Hottentots went
                    to work. <lb/>There was indeed a good deal of amusement connected with it,
                    <lb/>which, with them, is a great stimulus to exertion. Many very large
                    <lb/>stones were dislodged, and dragged to the building, on a strong sledge,
                    <lb/>by ten oxen. In separating two parts of an immense block, which, <lb/>by
                    some violence not accounted for, had a crack right through the <lb/>middle, a

                    stone seemed to afford protection to larger or smaller ants.<lb/> They differed
                    from those, which raise solid nests of clay in all parts <lb/>of the wilderness,
                    in shape like a baker’s oven, and used for that <lb/>purpose in the interior.
                    The Caffres, when first permitted to settle <lb/>at
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Gnadenthal</placeName>, before they could build ovens, according
                    to the <lb/>custom of their country, availed themselves of these tumuli, and
                    <lb/>having expelled or destroyed the inhabitants by fire and smoke,
                    <lb/>scooped them out hollow, leaving a crust of a few inches in thick<lb
                        break="no"/>ness, and used them for baking, putting in three loaves at a
                    time. <lb/>The clay of which the nests are formed, is so well prepared by
                    <lb/>by these industrious insects, that it is used for the floors of rooms,
                    <lb/>both by Hottentots and farmers.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-08-07">7th.</date> The people continued their work at
                    the stones as long as <lb/>the weather remained fine, and I frequently
                    accompanied <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother <lb/>Schmitt</persName>, when he attended them. No
                    European labourers could <lb/>work with greater diligence and effect. We had
                    engaged a Dambra <lb/>Hottentot, called <persName>Ephraim</persName>, to work in
                    a quarry at the top of the <lb/>eminence, where the granite was split into
                    irregular strata, nearly <lb/>in a perpendicular direction. The quarry yielded
                    good stone for <lb/>building walls. The large masses above ground, were of a
                    harder <lb/>texture, than the stones under the surface. Thin layers of schistus
                    <lb/>cleaved to some part of the latter. <persName>Ephraim</persName>
                    distinguished himself <lb/>by his steadiness and persevering diligence. The
                    Dambras differ <lb/>much in their manners from the Hottentots of this country,
                    they <lb/>are of a more swarthy complexion, and have features better formed.</p>
                <p><lb/>When a large stone was dislodged, I generally met with some<lb break="no"
                    />thing deserving attention. To-day I saw, for the first time, that <lb/>singular
                    animal, called by the Hottentots, the mountain-salamander. <lb/>It is shaped
                    like a lizard, but broader, seven or eight inches long, and <lb/>scaly. The
                    scales on the tail are pointed, and stand off from the <lb/>body, but whether
                    generally, or only in fright or anger, I cannot tell. <lb/>A nest of young

                <p><lb/>By the operation of grubbing up, and removing these stones, <lb/>which may

                    could, but was obliged to submit to <lb/>the necessity of using the stones. The
                    ground was strewed with <lb/>flowers and bulbs, shattered aloe-leaves and
                    beautiful plants, but <lb/>I was assured, for my comfort, that, after a short
                    rest, the earth <lb/>would bring forth abundantly, and the aloes and fahlblar
                    again <lb/>adorn the spot. By far the greater part of the masses of stone,
                    <lb/>being beyond the power of man to move, they still present a singu<lb

                    a layer of a kind of pipe-clay, and to this we were obliged to <lb/>penetrate,
                    to get a firm foundation. In the afternoon, I visited <lb/>several families in

                    great dexterity, with which he executed the most difficult <lb/>passages, and
                    made them tell on the organ. I was displeased with <lb/>myself, for not being
                    more displeased with him.</p>
                <p><lb/>With a very highly esteemed friend, I had a conversation on <lb/>several
                    subjects, which made a deep impression upon me. Being <lb/>rather of an anxious
                    turn of mind, he expressed surprise at the con<lb break="no"/>fidence and
                    cheerfulness of some Christians. He related, that he <lb/>was educated in the
                    celebrated Paedagogium at <placeName role="mentioned">Halle</placeName> in <placeName role="mentioned">Saxony</placeName>, <lb/>where,
                    contrary to the intention of its founders, he and others were <lb/>taught to
                    entertain scruples concerning the principal doctrines of <lb/>Christianity, and
                    to explain away those scriptures, which the <lb/><hi rend="i">Neologen</hi>, or
                    Socinians and Deists, found to bear against their fa<lb break="no"/>vourite
                    opinions. But as he could find no comfort and peace in <lb/>the new doctrines of
                    self-enlightened men, he began well to consider <lb/>those, which they had
                    rejected, and, by slow degrees, seemed to ob<lb break="no"/>tain more faith in
                    them, and to consider them as the basis of all <lb/>sound religion. He wished,
                    however, to know my views of that <lb/>real and convincing experience of the
                    efficacy of faith in Jesus, <lb/>and the atonement made for sin, which a true
                    believer ought to <lb/>possess. I gave him a plain and faithful account of the
                    manner, <lb/>in which, “it pleased God to reveal his Son in me,” though natu<lb
                        break="no"/>rally averse to religion, falsely supposing, that it tended to
                    check <lb/>all cheerfulness, and the enjoyment of the pleasures of this life,
                    <lb/>whereas I now knew, that the only way to live happy, and innocently <lb/>to
                    enjoy that good, which God has left to us in this world, as “a <lb/>witness for
                    himself,” for our use, improvement, and comfort, was <lb/>to make sure, that He
                    is our Father, Friend, and Deliverer from <lb/>the curse and punishment of sin,
                    as declared in the Gospel.</p>
                <p><lb/>My friend observed, that ever since he had become acquainted <lb/>with me,
                    he had wondered, how a man of so lively a disposition, <lb/>could belong to a
                    conmunity so recluse and religious, as that of <lb/><orgName>the Church of the Brethren</orgName>,
                    in which there were so many checks, <pb n="329"/>

                    <lb/>by particular rules and regulations, against the ways of the world,
                    <lb/>and its pleasures and amusements. He added, however, that, in <lb/>general,
                    he had always found those members of our Church, with <lb/>whom he had become
                    acquainted, lively and cheerful people, and <lb/>attentive to the innocent means
                    of making their lives and dwellings <lb/>on earth comfortable. This led to a
                    consideration of the effects of <lb/>true conversion of heart, when a man is
                    turned from the love of <lb/>the world and sin to his God and Saviour, and has
                    his “con<lb break="no"/>versation in heaven.” To him it is no act of painful
                    self-denial, to <lb/>avoid the things that lead from God, and no punishment, to
                    be ex<lb break="no"/>cluded from them. Surely no one has more reason to be happy
                    <lb/>and contented, than the man who expects, that better things than
                    <lb/>those, which he now possesses, will shortly be his portion: he uses
                    <lb/>the world, yet as not abusing or cleaving to it; and enjoys all the
                    <lb/>gifts of his Creator with a thankful heart. But I felt, that I ought
                    <lb/>to take his remark as a kind admonition, to beware, lest too much
                    <lb/>vivacity and attention to objects, which afford pleasure to the <lb/>mind,
                    and engage the activity of the intellectual part of man, <lb/>though sinless in
                    themselves, should sometimes lead to forgetfulness <lb/>of higher and more

                    wood, I endeavoured to <lb/>impress upon the people the necessity of attending
                    to the mak<lb break="no"/>ing of hedges, and that plantations should be promoted
                    as much <lb/>as possible, yet under proper regulations, that there may be no

                    about this time, <lb/>gave the best advice, being well versed in the management

                    He also pronoun<lb break="no"/>ced the pipe-clay under the sand, to be a good

                    in the work, and <lb/>there was no want of hands. The stone was of a triangular

                <p><lb/>The service was conducted in the following manner: <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q124708971">Brother

                    <lb/>manner which has given general satisfaction.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Schroeder</persName>, having given us some good advice, left
                    us in the <lb/>afternoon. We met this evening to make arrangements previous
                    <lb/>to my departure.</p>
                <p><lb/>There is in this country a plant, called by the Hottentots Da<lb break="no"
                    />cha, a species of wild hemp, (cicuta). Some of them smoke it <lb/>like
                    tobacco, or mix it with the latter herb, and are exceedingly <lb/>fond of it.
                    Its effects upon the human body are dreadful. It not <lb/>only takes away the
                    senses for a season, even more completely <lb/>than drunkenness, but, by
                    degrees, undermines the constitution, <lb/>weakens every faculty of mind and
                    body, and makes cripples of <lb/><sic>thoset hat</sic> continue in the practice.
                    It is necessary, therefore, <lb/>that most determined resistance should be made
                    against this de<lb break="no"/>structive propensity, and by a rule established
                    in our settlements, <lb/>the use of dacha is to be entirely abandoned. Whoever
                    is <lb/>guilty of smoking it, is excluded; but a seducer of others to the
                    <lb/>abominable practice, expelled. The chief complaint against <lb/>the
                    Hottentots is, that they are incorrigibly lazy, and unfit for <lb/>labour. In
                    most instances, the cause of it is the use of this poi<lb break="no"/>sonous
                    herb. Who would believe, therefore, that the very men <lb/>who complain, should
                    encourage the growth of it in their grounds, <lb/>and sell it to the Hottentots!
                    Yet this I have seen with my own <lb/>eyes, even where I least suspected it.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-09-01">September 1st.</date> Being Sunday, the
                    Hottentots came in parties, <lb/>between the services, to take leave of me, and
                    with many of them <lb/>I entered into pleasant conversation. There were some
                    good <lb/>spokesmen among them, who expressed the sentiments of their
                    <lb/>brethren in very affectionate terms. Two Dambras,
                        <persName>Ephraim</persName> and <lb/><persName>Peter</persName>, gave me
                    particular satisfaction, by the modest, unaffected <lb/>manner, in which they

                    <lb break="no"/>tions, that <placeName role="mentioned">South Africa</placeName> remains, and I
                    fear, must in a great degree <lb/>remain, a wilderness. After all the
                    observations I have been able <lb/>to make and to collect, during my journey
                    through great part of <placeName role="mentioned">the <lb/>colony</placeName>, I must ascribe this deficiency to the
                    character of the South <lb/>African mountains. Almost all their summits consist
                    of precipitous <lb/>rocks. Very little earth, consequently very few morasses are
                    <lb/>found upon them, and the rain, which is abundant in the rainy <lb/>season,
                    instead of falling on a spungy soil, retaining the water <lb/>for a considerable
                    time, and gradually dealing it out in rivulets <lb/>and brooks, dashes with
                    violence, from the rocks, down the steep <lb/>declivities, and in destructive
                    torrents sweeps along the kloofs and <lb/>vallies, frequently and suddenly
                    destroying the labours of many <lb/>years in places, where, in summer, a small
                    streamlet scarcely fur<lb break="no"/>nishes water sufficient for the use of a
                    family. The bushes, cover<lb break="no"/>ing a great part of the waste,
                    preserve, by their shade, some moisture <lb/>on the ground, and are
                    providentially furnished with roots of dis<lb break="no"/>proportionate
                    thickness, which, imbibing the water, give them <lb/>sustenance, and maintain
                    their verdure in the dry season. It is <lb/>also said, that in many beds of
                    torrents, by digging, water may <lb/>be found, though the heat of the sun has
                    banished all appear<lb break="no"/>ance of it from the surface.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-09-04">4th.</date> Though the rain had continued
                    violent all night, we ventur<lb break="no"/>ed to proceed. Heavy showers
                    occurred all day; but when we <lb/>proposed to spend the night at <placeName role="mentioned">the

                    an unsafe fording-place, to cross <placeName role="mentioned">the Sand<lb break="no"

                    followed his advice, found <rs type="place" role="visited">the beach</rs> a good hard road, and though the surf
                    looked rather wild, <lb/>and in some places rushed in upon us as high as the

                        <persName>Jephtha</persName> riding before us. <lb/>By God’s mercy, we

                <p><lb/>I was engaged all day in visiting my friends. At <placeName role="visited">the Colo<lb

                    return to <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName> in <name type="vessel">the Zebra</name> sloop of <lb/>war. In

                <p><lb/>We spent a very pleasant evening with <persName>the Rev. Mr.

                    who declared his intention of <lb/>making a journey into the interior, to visit

                    deserved no thanks for offering me a passage on board the Ze<lb break="no"/>bra,
                    as he was seeking his own profit by it, wishing me to accom<lb break="no"/>pany
                    <rs type="person">his son <persName>Plantagenet</persName></rs>, who was going to

                    distressed not to be able immediately to <lb/>comply with his wish, the more so,

                    during my stay in <placeName role="mentioned">the <lb/>colony</placeName>. The engagement I had made with

                    <lb/>an arrangement was made, by which I was set at liberty, to the <lb/>entire

                    I was glad to see, as having been the residence of our late missionary,
                    <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123420263">P. Kohrhammer</persName>, when, in <date when-iso="1805">1805</date>, he was appointed Chaplain

                    walked out to see the gardens. They lie in a hollow, below the house, and are
                    laid out in the Dutch style, with a covered walk. The vineyards are situated on
                    an eminence, gently sloping towards the east. Many of the vines are old, and
                    will be removed next year, to make room for others. They are without spaliers or
                    poles, standing singly, like currant-bushes in a garden. The rich, sweet,
                    <placeName role="mentioned">Constantia</placeName> wine grows only within a certain boundary. <persName>Mr. Colin, junior</persName>, pointed
                    out a hedge, behind which, all attempts to raise the same grape have failed. We

                    man was an old slave, of a frolicsome turn, kept for <lb/>the amusement of the

                    suppose I lost no instruction by <lb/>it. Though his office seemed to be that of
                    a jester, kept to fill up <lb/>the vacuities occurring in African conversation,
                    his presence was <lb/>very annoying. Much rather would we have seen the natural

                    <lb/>that being her Christian name. He was a man of great activity;

                    makes the most of it. The low hills to the <lb/>right, are adorned with a

                    <lb/>me with the tail of a pylstort, (arrow-tail), a fish caught in
                            <placeName role="mentioned">Simon’s<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>bay</placeName>. The
                    tail itself is slender, and about fourteen inches in length. <lb/>From the upper

                    inches long, which the fish can turn <lb/>in any direction, inflicting a most
                    severe and dangerous wound <lb/>on its enemy. Every tooth of this bony saw acts
                    as a barb, and <lb/>if once inserted, cannot be extracted without great

                    <lb/>through a barren, sandy wilderness, with not a cultivated spot on
                    <lb/>either side. But the bountiful Creator has likewise here clothed <lb/>the

                    cover the sand between the bushes, as with a rich carpet. <lb/>We discovered
                    several tortoises waddling along, and took up five, <lb/>being varieties of the

                    caused a considerable swell and surf, which, <lb/>after dismounting on the
                    beach, kept us at a respectful distance <lb/>from the advancing surges. On their

                    ignorant of the transaction. <persName>Mr. Dashwood</persName> expressed himself
                    perfectly satisfied with the explanation given, and I felt anxious to remove the
                    unpleasant impression made by misrepresentation, purposely employed by a known

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-09-24">24th.</date> Every morning I am greeted by the
                    pleasant chirping of <lb/>two swallows, cock and hen, which have a nest in a
                    corner of the <lb/>room, under the <sic>cieling</sic>. There is hardly a room,
                    kitchen, or <lb/>out-house in the country without these inmates, and it would be
                    <lb/>thought next to murder to kill them. They build their nests of <lb/>clay,
                    in the shape of a bottle, the bottom being fixed to the wall, <lb/>and the neck
                    serving for the entrance. Into these bottle-shaped <lb/>nests, they convey the
                    softest down. As far as I was able to <lb/>watch them, both cock and hen assist
                    in the construction, or re<lb break="no"/>pairs of the nest, which remains for
                    their use during their emigra<lb break="no"/>tion. The same birds always return
                    to the same nests, and if it <lb/>happens, that by white-washing the room, the
                    outside of the nest <lb/>has been whitened, they carefully cover about half the
                    length of <lb/>the neck with fresh clay, before they make a new bed.</p>
                <p><lb/>As the upper half of the room-door, generally stands open dur<lb break="no"

                    shut, they give notice of their wish to go abroad, to fetch <lb/>either
                    materials or food, by a gentle piping and flying about the <lb/>room, and none
                    think it too troublesome to let them out. At <lb/>dawn of day, they are heard
                    chirping their morning-song, before <lb/>they leave the nest. I have often left
                    my bed, to open the door <lb/>for them.</p>
                <p><lb/>These birds are shaped like the European swallows, but, under <lb/>their
                    wings, of a red-brown colour. They leave the country <lb/>during the winter.
                    They are persecuted by a bird called the wild <lb/>swallow, black and white in
                    colour, which is said to kill the do<lb break="no"/>mestic one, and
                        <sic>sieze</sic> upon its nest. The wild are on that ac<lb break="no"/>count

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-09-25">25th.</date> Having heard much of the singular
                    appearance of the <lb/>range of Dünen, or sand-hills, along <rs type="place" role="visited">the coast</rs>, I rode
                    thither with <lb/><persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123396697">Brother Fritsch</persName>, and was struck with
                    surprise, when we entered <lb/>among them. Their appearance from
                        <placeName role="mentioned">Groenekloof</placeName> is rather <lb/>unpleasant, and not unlike
                    a low sandy dyke, skirting the waste <lb/>in a straight line. But I found them
                    occupying a very wide field, <lb/>extending to several miles from the sea-coast.
                    The fine sand, <lb/>which is chiefly pulverized quartz, and as white as snow, is
                    here <lb/>blown about, like sleet on a frozen surface, forming hillocks of
                    <lb/>considerable height, and in shape, resembling huge drifts of snow. <lb/>The
                    flats between them are destitute of any verdure, the surface <lb/>being almost
                    constantly in motion. To-day the south-east wind <lb/>blew pretty strong, and
                    small parallel ridges were continually <lb/>forming over the whole surface, by
                    its operation upon the sand. <lb/>In other parts, especially where deep recesses
                    or glens are defended <lb/>by the hillocks, the waxberry-bush has found shelter,
                    and grows <lb/>in great abundance. To a superficial observer, it appears not
                    <lb/>unlike box. Some of the stems are as thick as a man’s leg, and <lb/>the
                    bushes from eight to ten feet in height.</p>
                <p><lb/>Our path wound round between the hillocks, sometimes over <lb/>soft sand,
                    through which the horses waded heavily, and again <lb/>over a hard bottom, like
                    frozen snow. In a deep glen, we saw <lb/>several of our people from

                    wax-berries. They sent a little boy to show us the <lb/>way to a place

                    <lb/>right to this property and our people were required to ask their
                    <lb/>permission to gather the berries. Though this had been done, <lb/>a man had
                    yesterday warned off the women engaged in boiling <lb/>wax; they had therefore

                    friends, they produced it, and showed <lb/>us the process, which is perfectly

                    <lb/>skimmed off with a spoon. Two kinds of wax-berry bushes grow <lb/>here, one
                    smaller than the other. The berries of both, have much <lb/>the appearance of

                    <lb/>most of the bricks, in drying, cracked by the heat of the sun. <lb/>This

                    were feeding among the bushes, and, as the <lb/>herdsmen informed us, safely,
                    though the whole region is considered <lb/>as the haunt of wolves and tygers.
                    Several ledges of rocks, which <lb/>overhang dells, filled with high bushes,
                    form here snug retreats for <lb/>wild beasts of every description. Formerly it

                    work, came riding <lb/>towards us, and began to take them to task: “You must do
                    so and <lb/>so,” said he; “you know nothing about setting up a kiln, your
                    <lb/>bricks will never get burnt, &amp;c.” To every sentence, their answer
                    <lb/>was, “Ya, Mynheer! Ya, Mynheer!” Having finished his lecture, <lb/>the boor
                    rode off in a gallop, but was no sooner out of hearing, <lb/>than they began to
                    make their remarks: “That man,” said they, <lb/>“thinks himself very wise,
                    because he is a rich boor; but we must <lb/>“do our own way, or the bricks will
                    never be burnt. His bricks <lb/>“are accustomed to his way, but our bricks can
                    only be burnt in <lb/>“our way.” They seem to have been in the right, for I have
                    since <lb/>heard, that their kiln answered perfectly well, and their bricks were

                <p><lb/>I dined at <rs type="place" role="visited">the <persName>Rev. Mr. Hesse</persName>’s</rs>, who entered upon the

                    <lb/>which led our friend into a detail, to show his reasons for taking
                    <lb/>such a step. They were sufficiently cogent. To me it was interest<lb

                    <lb/>and that, if the minister were entirely to relax in the performance <lb/>of

                        <persName>Mr. Hancke</persName>, we were not deterred by the appear<lb

                        <persName>Hesse</persName>, <lb/>and myself. It was their intention to reach

                    could get no farther than <rs type="place" role="visited"><persName>Mr.

                    the hill. There a heavy shower kept us prisoners for <lb/>some time, when we
                    proceeded, in hopes of better weather. The <lb/>air was clear, and, as we walked
                    up the kloof, between <placeName role="visited_nearby">the Lion’s <lb/>head</placeName> and
                        <placeName role="visited_nearby">Table-Mountain</placeName>, we had a good view of the town and

                    however, was made by the coolness of the air, which <lb/>made walking pleasant.
                    On reaching the top of the kloof, an ex<lb break="no"/>tensive prospect rewards
                    the traveller, and the range of rocks and <lb/>precipices, forming the

                    promontories of <placeName role="visited_nearby">Hout-bay</placeName> have a grand appearance. Turning
                    <lb/>to the right, round <placeName role="visited">the Lion’s head</placeName>, we arrived at <rs type="place" role="visited">a

                    by clothing the steep ascent with plan<lb break="no"/>tations of Witteboom and

                    <lb/>rendered me, during the whole of my abode in the colony. The <lb/>two
                    latter gentlemen gave me the pleasure of their company, till we <lb/>reached the

                <p><lb/>When I arrived on board, I found every thing prepared to re<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>was on shore, and it was so settled, that if his gig returned without

                    afternoon. <lb/>By some mistake the gig was reported to be coming off empty,
                    <lb/>and <rs type="person">the lieutenant</rs> ordered the flags and awnings to be taken <lb/>down.
                    This was instantly done, when the gig was seen swiftly <lb/>approaching the

                    seemed pleased with the ship, and the arrange<lb break="no"/>ments made, and sat
                    down to the cold collation. When they re<lb break="no"/>turned to shore, a
                    salute of seventeen guns was fired, a company of <lb/>artillery on board

                    <lb/>forty or fifty sheep, several of which died on the passage. Every <lb/>man
                    of war, sailing from <placeName role="mentioned">the Cape</placeName>, was charged with some
                        arti<lb break="no"/>cles, either of provision or manufacture, for this

                <p><lb/>My little cabin was my sanctuary, and the hurry and noise in <lb/>the

                    and true charity, being <lb/>more disposed to excuse and make allowances, than
                    to find fault <lb/>and judge severely, is certainly the duty of a true
                    Christian, but <lb/>the manner of doing it, with any hopes of success, is not
                    the gift <lb/>of every one, who feels the obligation. But there was not an

                    subjects, on which we differed in sentiment or expres<lb break="no"/>sion.</p>
                <p><lb/>A small shelf had been put up in my cabin, which contained a <lb/>few books.
                    Every morning, when I awoke, the bull’s eye giving <lb/>me sufficient light, I
                    read the Scripture-texts appointed for every <lb/>day in our Church, with the
                    two chapters from which they were <lb/>taken, adding sometimes larger portions
                    of the Scriptures, as I <lb/>was led on, by the importance of the subjects, and
                    the great de<lb break="no"/>light and comfort I enjoyed in this practice. Never

                    many of the great truths contained in it, than I had ever before <lb/>possessed.
                    To enter largely upon the subject, would be here out <lb/>of place, but I trust,

                    received with great coolness by the old ma<lb break="no"/>riners, and as we

                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-10-28">28th.</date> I was early on deck, expecting to

                        Helena</placeName> is often represented. I was <lb/>surprised, therefore, to
                    see a long, high, and, from that distance, <lb/>smooth-looking land, exhibiting
                    nothing striking or picturesque; <lb/>but, as we approached, more of its
                    peculiar features were visible, <lb/>and its appearance became interesting. No
                    coast I have ever <lb/>seen, looks more desolate; and one may easily conceive
                    the an<lb break="no"/>guish of the ladies who accompanied
                        <persName>Bonaparte</persName>, to have been as <lb/>great as described,
                    when they beheld the black dismal precipices, <lb/>without a blade of grass or
                    bush upon them, among which they <lb/>were perhaps to spend the remainder of
                    their lives. Several <lb/>kloofs, (to keep up the old favourite appellation),
                    divide the <lb/>masses of ragged rocks. They appear filled with a black mould,
                    <lb/>the crumbling fragments of decomposed volcanic substances.</p>
                <p><lb/>We soon discovered the Podargus sloop of war, cruizing off the <lb/>island,
                    and, by signal, sailed towards her. <persName>Captain Wallis</persName>, her

                <p><lb/>On a nearer approach, several curious peaks, rocks of fanciful <lb/>shape,
                    and caverns near the sea, attracted my attention. The <lb/>general colour of the
                    rocks is dark-grey, with fissures and veins <lb/>of a brown-yellow tint.
                    Batteries are placed on several eminen<lb break="no"/>ces, forming a line of

                <p><lb/>When we had come to an anchor, <rs type="person">the officer of the guard</rs> came <lb/>on board,
                    with whom <persName>Mr. Somerset</persName> and <persName>Captain

                    spending the day on <lb/>board, wishing to write letters, and complete my

                    had procured per<lb break="no"/>mission for me to land, reported, that having
                    seen the <persName>Governor, <lb/>Sir Hudson Lowe</persName>, he had invited him
                    to dinner at <rs type="place" role="mentioned">Plantation<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>house, his

                    kinds on shore. I was thus persuaded to <lb/>accompany him.</p>
                <p><lb/>The weather was so mild, that there was hardly any surf, which is
                    <lb/>sometimes very troublesome, even at the jetty. The landing-place <lb/>lies
                    under vast, and almost perpendicular rocks. About three hun<lb break="no"/>dred
                    yards to the left, an abutment of the rock forms an arch, like <lb/>that of a
                    flying buttress. To the right, the road passes over a draw<lb break="no"

                    commanding <lb/>the entrance of the harbour. To the left, storehouses and
                    offices <lb/>range behind an avenue of trees, the stems of which are remark<lb
                        break="no"/>ably crooked and ill-grown.</p>
                <p><lb/>About the middle of this range of buildings, a gate admits the

                    <lb/>his name, and declare his business. Our first visit was to
                        <persName>Captain <lb/>Stansfield</persName>, the senior naval officer,
                    acting as commodore, in ab<lb break="no"/>sence of the admiral, <persName>Sir

                <p><lb/>I was received with great politeness by <persName>Captain

                    <lb/>pretty sure, that I should find enough to amuse me for some <lb/>hours,
                    when the arrival of <persName>Sir Thomas Reade</persName>, the Adjutant<lb

                    contrivances. <lb/>When he heard the plan I had formed, he protested, that I
                    should <lb/>not quit my company, but accompany <rs type="person">the captain</rs>
                    and <persName>Mr. So<lb break="no"/>merset</persName> to
                        <rs type="place" role="mentioned">Plantation-house</rs> to dinner. With the most obliging
                    <lb/>opposition to all my remonstrances, he fairly compelled me to join <lb/>the
                    cavalcade, and we set out with <rs type="person">the Governor</rs>’s adjutant,
                            <persName>Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant Pritchard</persName>, all well

                <p><lb/>The road up <placeName role="visited">Ladder-hill</placeName> is a steep zigzag, and were
                    there not a <lb/>parapet of about three feet in height skirting it towards the
                    declivity, <lb/>the view downwards would be frightful. At the top of the hill, a
                    <lb/>battery commands both the road, and the gate leading to it from <lb/>the
                    plain above. The mass of rocks, and the innumerable frag<lb break="no"/>ments
                    lying on the hill, bear evident marks of their having once <lb/>been in a state
                    of fusion. The traces of that dreadful eruption, by <lb/>which this singular
                    island was lifted up above the surface of the <lb/>ocean, appear in all
                    directions. To the right, on the waste above, <lb/>we were made particularly
                    attentive to a number of gullies, in par<lb break="no"/>allel lines, resembling
                    torrents of burning lava. An attempt has <lb/>been made to plant a hedge of
                    Indian fig, on each side of the road, <lb/>but it does not seem to thrive

                    changes <lb/>from a wilderness to a garden. The declivities of the hills are
                    <lb/>covered with short grass of the most lively green, and their summits,

                    scoriæ, some containing chrystals of shoerl <lb/>and olivin, and, as I
                    apprehend, magnetic iron, quite similar in ap<lb break="no"/>pearance to many I
                    have seen from the neighbourhood of <placeName role="mentioned">Ætna</placeName> <lb/>and <placeName role="mentioned">Vesuvius</placeName>. Some of the cavities
                    were filled with a bright yellow <lb/>coating, but I found no zeolith in any of
                    them.</p>
                <p><lb/>Pursuing my walk, under beautiful groves of trees of various
                    <lb/>descriptions, I arrived at the hill, which is covered with a young
                    <lb/>plantation of firs and other evergreens. From the upper walk ob<lb
                        break="no"/>serving a black rock at some distance, I made towards it, and
                    found <lb/>it to consist of amorphous basaltes. While I was employed, without
                    <lb/>proper tools, in knocking off some specimens, the barking of a dog <lb/>at
                    the door of a neighbouring house, brought out the proprietor, <lb/>with whom I
                    had some conversation.</p>
                <p><lb/>Turning down a footpath to the bottom of the rock, I found a <lb/>quarry,
                    and in it a vein of a substance, by the Germans called <lb/>Steinmark
                    (stone-marrow), but of so brittle a nature, that I <lb/>could get but very small
                    specimens. Two hours passed swiftly and <lb/>pleasantly away, and when I
                    returned to the house, I found <rs type="person">the <lb/>Governor</rs> in his
                    library, and we soon met to breakfast. On <persName>Cap<lb break="no"/>tain

                    <lb/>had confined him to his room for several days. No hopes, there<lb

                <p><lb/>Before we set out. <persName>Sir Hudson</persName> proposed a walk through
                    his own <lb/>grounds, part of which I had previously seen. <rs type="person">His
                        Excellency</rs> point<lb break="no"/>ed out many foreign trees,
                    growing here in great perfection, among <lb/>which, some have not yet been
                    described by botanists. The Chinese <lb/>yew; the coffee-tree; cinnamon and

                    <lb/>island-pine, a most beautiful species, growing in its native soil to
                    <lb/>the enormous height of from three hundred and fifty to three hundred
                    <lb/>and eighty feet; the gum-tree; cabbage-tree; dog-tree, and goble<lb
                        break="no"/>keer, bearing a small sky-blue flower; and others, deserve
                        parti<lb break="no"/>cular attention. Some oaks of vast magnitude and
                    spread, form a <lb/>delightful bower, under which, in that hot climate, one may
                    enjoy <lb/>the comfort of a shady retreat, inluiling an atmosphere, perfumed
                    <lb/>by the fragrance of a profusion of the sweetest plants and flowers. <lb/>We
                    noticed a peculiar kind of grass, called mat-grass, from its <lb/>spreading most
                    luxuriantly over the ground, in such thickness, <lb/>that it forms a cover
                    resembling thick matting, with long tendrils <lb/>like quick-grass. <rs type="person">The
                        Governor</rs> ordered a large sod, covered <lb/>with it, to
                    be put into a tub and sent on board, which I brought to

                <p><lb/>The kitchen-gardens are large and well-watered by springs from <lb/>the

                    By this means, the water is saved from being lost in the <lb/>sand, or loose
                    earth, as it passes along. Where this method is prac<lb break="no"/>ticable, it
                    should be adopted in <placeName role="mentioned">South Africa</placeName>, and in other places, <pb n="373"/>

                    <lb/>for the purpose of irrigation. I am confident, that such a measure

                    with a dragoon and groom. <persName>Sir Hudson</persName> proposed first <lb/>to
                    ride to <placeName role="visited">Sandy-bay</placeName>, one of the most romantic spots in the
                    island. <lb/>The views on all sides are singularly beautiful. Many fertile and
                    <lb/>well-wooded hills present themselves to the right, one of which is
                    <lb/>called <placeName role="visited_nearby">High Peak</placeName>. <placeName role="visited_nearby">Diana’s
                        Peak</placeName> lies more to the left, and is <lb/>considered the highest
                    point in the whole island. After crossing <lb/>several hills and dales, by a
                    zigzag road, their steepness never ad<lb break="no"/>mitting of a strait line,
                    we reached the ridge, overlooking the bay. <lb/>The view of the valley is beyond
                    description grand. Hills and <lb/>rocks of most singular forms surround a deep
                    hollow, within which <lb/>rises a woody hill with two peaks, one ascending
                    considerably <lb/>above the other. Between them, surrounded by gardens and
                        shrub<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>beries, lies the elegant <rs type="place" role="visited_nearby">villa of
                        <persName>Mr. Doveton</persName></rs>. He was born in this <lb/>island, and is
                    one of the members of council. Behind the house <lb/>seen, from the place where
                    we stood, between the two peaks, rises a <lb/>huge rock, like a sugar-loaf,
                    called <placeName role="visited_nearby">Lot</placeName>. In the back-ground, is a <lb/>range of hills,
                    truly volcanic in their appearance, intersected by <lb/>numerous glens and
                    gullies, of almost every colour, but chiefly <lb/>violet, with tinges of yellow,
                    red, dark-brown, and a greenish-grey; <lb/>the summit of the range is crowned
                    with peaks of brown and black <lb/>rocks, rising in succession. On its most
                    elevated part, a rock, consi<lb break="no"/>derably higher than the rest, and
                    leaning towards the right, has <lb/>the odd name of <placeName role="mentioned">Lot’s

                    are called <placeName role="mentioned">Lot’s children</placeName>. The whole landscape <lb/>is
                    the most strange combination of objects imaginable, and <persName>Sir

                    proposed <lb/>that I should make it the business of to-morrow, as our time

                        <persName>Sir Hudson</persName> pointed out to us the situation of
                        <lb/><placeName role="visited">Longwood</placeName>, as peculiarly calculated to prevent

                    in cir<lb break="no"/>cumference, lie upon a kind of inland peninsula, the only
                        prac<lb break="no"/>ticable access to which, is between <placeName role="mentioned">the

                    descending towards the sea, or between <lb/><placeName role="mentioned">the flag-staff hill</placeName>, and the other
                    end of <placeName role="mentioned">the Punch-bowl</placeName>. Both <lb/>these roads are
                    sufficiently defended by troops. As far as the guard<lb break="no"/>house, and
                    within the twelve miles, <persName>General Bonaparte</persName> may ride,
                    <lb/>and amuse himself as he pleases; but if he wishes to exceed those
                    <lb/>limits, an officer must accompany him. He finds this extremely
                    <lb/>unpleasant, and requested the officer to dress like a common gen<lb

                    <lb/>refuse.</p>
                <p><lb/>After entering the gate, we rode up to another enclosure, where
                        <lb/><persName>Sir Hudson</persName> desired us to wait, till he had

                    the rest of the domain being principally covered with gum <lb/>trees standing
                    singly. In a short time. <persName>Sir Hudson</persName> returned from the
                    <lb/>house, with an account, that <persName>General Bonaparte</persName> was
                    very ill with a <lb/>swelled face and gums, and could not leave his room. This
                    answer <lb/>we had expected, and contented ourselves with riding about the

                    <lb/>which he commonly breakfasts, and spends a good deal of time.</p>
                <p><lb/><persName>Bertrand</persName> has a separate house, a little lower down the
                        de<lb break="no"/>clivity, at a small distance from his master’s. We saw him
                    and <lb/><persName>Monthollon</persName>, with their ladies, walking in the
                    park. The mansion <lb/>itself is rather an assemblage of buildings, than one
                    whole house. <lb/>The dining-room, with its viranda, is the principal feature,
                    and has <lb/>three large windows. Connected with it, are <persName>General
                        Bonaparte</persName>’s <lb/>own apartments, the principal one turning its
                    gable-end towards the <lb/>entrance. Behind that, if I am correct, follow those
                    of the Captain <lb/>on guard, <persName>Las Casas</persName>,
                        <persName>Gourgeon</persName>, and <persName>Monthollon</persName>. The
                    latter has <lb/>four windows. They are all one story high, whitened, with grey
                    <lb/>roofs.</p>
                <p><lb/>To the north-east, is a remarkable rock, from its shape called
                        <lb/><placeName role="visited_nearby">the Barn</placeName>, <lb/>rising perpendicularly from the
                    sea to a great height, <lb/>black, rugged, and without any trees. Farther
                    inland, lies a peaked <lb/>hill, called <placeName role="mentioned">the Flag-staff</placeName>.
                    Towards <placeName role="mentioned">the Barn</placeName> descends a narrow <lb/>vale, covered
                    with gravel of decomposed volcanic matter, in some <lb/>parts so red, that it
                    furnishes the imagination with the idea of a <lb/>burning torrent. Here and
                    there are patches of blue, yellow, and <lb/>violet, increasing the deception. We
                    had no time to fatigue our <lb/>horses by riding into it; and on our return to
                    the guard-house. <persName>Sir <lb/>Hudson</persName> very obligingly directed
                    his adjutant, <persName>Lieutenant Pritchard</persName>
                    <lb/>to attend me to any place, from which I might wish to make a sketch <lb/>of
                    the house and premises. He then returned home, <persName>Captain
                        Forbes</persName>
                    <lb/>and <persName>Sir Thomas Reade</persName> rode to
                        <placeName role="mentioned">James-town</placeName>, and <placeName>Mr. Somerset</placeName>
                    <lb/>favoured me with his company.</p>
                <p><lb/>We went round the north-east end of <placeName role="visited">the Punch-bowl</placeName>,
                    through <lb/><rs type="place" role="visited">the camp of the 53d regiment</rs>, but finding no good situation
                    <lb/>for a view, turned back towards the opposite height. Not far from <lb/>the
                    gate, I dismounted, and got a good general view of the house, <lb/>or
                    houses.</p>

                    <lb/>informed and intelligent. After they were gone, I retired into my <lb/>own
                    room, and finished my memorandums.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-10-30">30th.</date> I rose early, and began my

                    view of the house and <lb/>premises; then turning through the gates, went down
                    the hill on the <lb/>road to <placeName role="visited_nearby">Longwood</placeName>.

                    and a <lb/>smaller and larger drum. The composition, as well as the perform<lb

                <p><lb/>At breakfast, <persName>Sir Hudson</persName> proposed, that <persName>Mr.

                    set out in company <lb/>of <persName>Lieutenant Pritchard</persName>, for
                        <placeName role="visited">Sandy-bay</placeName>, taking a different route <lb/>from that of

                    got over a <lb/>wall, and obtained a fine view of the valley, but not equal to

                    <lb/>Here I attempted to take a very accurate view of this singular

                    <lb/>contrasted with the rugged masses of rock in their neighbourhood, <lb/>and
                    the wild waste around them. Yet even this waste was glo<lb break="no"/>riously
                    decorated with bushes of most luxuriant growth, chiefly of <lb/>furze, now in
                    full bloom, and both in the size and colour of its flowers, <lb/>incomparably
                    superior to that of <placeName role="mentioned">Europe</placeName>. Blackberry-bushes,
                    <lb/>likewise, which were first introduced as a rarity in a garden, have
                    <lb/>now become so plentiful, that they are considered as the worst of

                        break="no"/>tions. The summits of some of the hills are crowned with groves
                    <lb/>of gum and cabbage-trees, but the havock made of the wood, with <lb/>which
                    this island was formerly clothed, has been such, that, com<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>men on shore to cut as much as they wanted. Of course no care <lb/>was
                    taken to prevent waste. The subsequent introduction of goats, <lb/>which ran
                    wild, and multiplied very fast, was most ruinous to the <lb/>growth of young
                    plants and sprouts. These creatures proved at last <lb/>so great a nuisance,
                    that they were hunted, and almost destroyed. <lb/>There are no quadrupeds here,
                    which may be called aborigines. <lb/>Rats and mice have been brought hither by
                    ships. Of other crea<lb break="no"/>tures, except birds and reptiles, we have no
                    account. Scorpions <lb/>and centipedes are said to have always abounded.</p>
                <p><lb/>The houses of the English settlers in <placeName role="mentioned">St. Helena</placeName>, are

                    richer or poorer, are directed by some <lb/>good taste, and do not always first

                <p><lb/>Every account we heard of the disposition and conduct of <persName>Gene<lb

                    Not <lb/>only in prosperity, but in adversity, it will cleave to him, and ge<lb

                    <lb/>it is much easier, to support a pretence, and wear a mask, than in <lb/>a
                    state of affliction. While <persName>General Bonaparte</persName> was dictating
                    laws <lb/>to every nation but <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName>, and crowned heads

                    <lb/>that he had the wisdom to search out and employ the best agents <lb/>for

                        in<lb break="no"/>stance of the effect of his dissatisfaction about things
                    of minor im<lb break="no"/>portance, which came to my knowledge from the best
                    authority. <lb/>A butcher at <placeName role="mentioned">James-town</placeName>,
                    who used to deliver meat for his table, <lb/>being at length wearied out with
                    continual repetition of complaints, <lb/>though he furnished the best meat he
                    could procure, directed the <lb/>following laconic epistle to <rs type="person">the
                            Governor</rs>: "<persName>Sir
                        Hudson</persName>! May it <lb/>please <rs type="person">your Excellency</rs>,
                    this same <persName>General Bonaparte</persName> is hard to <lb/>please, I begs
                    to be excused sarving him any longer with meat.”</p>
                <p><lb/>As he hates <persName>Sir Hudson Lowe</persName>, the latter does not
                    unnecessarily <lb/>trouble him with his presence, but delivers all notices to
                    him by <lb/><persName>Sir Thomas Reade</persName>, whose polished manners,
                    good-humoured dispo<lb break="no"/>sition, and knowledge of the Italian
                    language, which <persName>General Bona<lb break="no"/>parte</persName> is said
                    to prefer to French in conversation, makes him a plea<lb break="no"/>sant
                    messenger. <persName>Sir Thomas</persName> has therefore had more opportunities
                    <lb/>of becoming acquainted with him in the various affections of his <lb/>mind,
                    than most Englishmen, with whom he has conversed.</p>
                <p><lb/>A proof of great meanness is this, that he will not give credit to <lb/>the
                    English for any great warlike action. He says, that by all the <lb/>rules of
                    war, <hi rend="i">he</hi> ought to have gained the battle of <placeName
                        role="mentioned">Waterloo</placeName>, and <lb/>that the <persName>Duke of
                        Wellington</persName> ought, if he had been a good General, <lb/>to have
                    retreated, and not made his stand where he did. Yet at <lb/>other times, feeling
                    peculiarly indignant at the Prussians, he, of <lb/>course, will not allow them
                    to have had any share in the result of <lb/>that action, but describes his
                    defeat to the firmness of the English <lb/>infantry alone, by which all his
                    plans were disconcerted.</p>
                <p><lb/>It is not my intention to add to the numberless accounts given <lb/>of this
                    celebrated captive, who thinks that he has friends and de<lb break="no"/>fenders
                    enough among the English nation. Not having seen and <lb/>spoken with him
                    myself, I can only repeat what has been said by <lb/>others, and as to those
                    communications, which are made in the <lb/>course of friendly and unguarded
                    conversation, I am of opinion, <lb/>that, without special permission, common

                <p><lb/>Most of the officers on board saw this island for the first time. <lb/>We

                    beach was as white as snow, with black, rugged rocks inter<lb break="no"
                    />spersed. Behind it, a horrid waste, with black gullies between <lb/>the
                    hillocks. The latter differed in height, and seemed chiefly <lb/>heaps of
                    scoriæ, of a conical form, one set up above the other, and <lb/>enclosing higher
                    hills of a dark-brown colour. A high mountain <lb/>rising in the centre of the
                    island, showed three peaks. A black <lb/>cloud rested upon it for some time, and
                    is said generally to obscure <lb/>the summit, but we were favoured with so clear
                    a sky, that the <lb/>cloud, though hovering above, seldom descended upon it.</p>
                <p><lb/>One headland after the other presented itself, as we ran down; <lb/>and no
                    vessel being seen for some time, <rs type="person">the Captain</rs> began to en<lb

                <p><lb/>Some of the strata of the rocks along the coast are singular, <lb/>both as

                    generally follow each other downwards thus: blueish-<lb break="no"

                    white, <lb/>near the beach. All seem to consist of a rotten, crumbling stone.
                    <lb/>Not a green spot is to be seen. The whole island is a huge mass <lb/>of

                <p><lb/>Large flights of the frigate-bird, and other sea-fowl, kept hovering

                    encouraged by the finest weather, with little wind <lb/>and surf, and every

                    disregarding the surgeon’s advice; nor blamed as pre<lb break="no"/>sumptuous,
                    in venturing, at the risk of a little increase of pain, to <lb/>visit a place of

                    deeper or lighter brown co<lb break="no"/>lour. Some look yellow and violet. At
                    a distance, the brown <lb/>tints change to a deep purple. On the great mountain,
                    the colour <lb/>is a blueish-grey, with greenish spots owing to the growth of a
                        spe<lb break="no"/>cies of milk-bush, here called parsley, and considered
                    poisonous. <lb/>The white colour of some of the rocks seems to proceed from
                        cal<lb break="no"/>careous substances.</p>
                <p><lb/>We were informed by the officers, that there may be about <lb/>twenty acres
                    in the island fit for cultivation. They have made a <lb/>garden on the great
                    mountain, but they must fetch their supply <lb/>of garden-stuff, turf for
                    firing, and fresh water, from a distance of <lb/>from seven to nine miles. No
                    tree is to be seen throughout the whole <lb/>island. Two small springs of fresh
                    water are known, the nearest, <lb/>seven miles from the tents. But it is rather
                    a continual dropping <lb/>from a rock, than a regular spring, and yields two
                    tons in twenty-<lb break="no" type="hyphenated"/>four hours. The second is at
                    the garden, near the summit of the <lb/>great mountain, nine miles distant from
                    the battery, and in the <lb/>same space of time, yields one hundred and forty
                    gallons. As <lb/> our water on board sent forth a very unpleasant smell, and
                    could not <lb/>be used, the sweet water of this island was considered by us as a
                    <lb/>great luxury.</p>
                <p><lb/>The two naval Captains having joined us on shore, we took a <lb/>walk with

                    powdered cinders, so trouble<lb break="no"/>some to the feet, that after forcing
                    ourselves forward for about two <lb/>miles, we were obliged to return. In all
                    directions, nothing but <lb/>the most barren and desolate region met our view.
                    It appeared <lb/>as if the tremendous eruption, by which this island has been
                    raised <lb/>from the depths of the ocean, had but lately ceased.</p>
                <p><lb/>When we had regained the coast, the Captains returned on <lb/>board.

                <p><lb/>The establishment at <placeName role="mentioned">Ascension</placeName>, was

                    apprehension, that unless we took formal possession of this island, some other
                    power, or adventurer, might make it a steppingstone to forward his escape.</p>
                <p><lb/>The sun shone in full splendor, and illumined the whole island. <lb/>It is a

                    One would not imagine that nature’s pencil could give <lb/>such effect to so
                    desolate a spot. I endeavoured to obtain an ex<lb break="no"/>act sketch of the
                    whole coast, before which we lay, and as the <lb/> cloud had entirely withdrawn

                    meanwhile enjoyed the pleasure of long contemplating one <lb/>of the finest

                    in black clouds, of threatening aspect, <lb/>but appearing stationary. The full

                    the sky being covered <lb/>with dark clouds, and the moon set, a ship coming
                    from the east<lb break="no"/>ward, approached us within two cable-lengths. She
                    hoisted lights, <lb/>but the night was so dark, that she was not immediately
                    perceived <lb/>by the men on the look-out. By God’s providence, she did not
                    <lb/>run foul of us, which, as she was coming in full sail, and right
                    <lb/>before the wind, might have proved a serious injury to both <lb/>vessels.
                    The wind freshened towards evening, and we ran at the <lb/>rate of from eight
                    and a half to ten knots an hour.</p>

                    <lb break="no"/>fore our door cried, Log-time! The officer of the watch on deck:
                    <lb/>Heave the log! Hold the reel! Shortly after: Strike the bell! <lb/><name type="vessel">The

                        role="mentioned">Simon’s bay</placeName>, it sounded like an old tin kettle,
                    till <lb/>the broken piece fell out, by which its tone was improved. This
                    <lb/>lasted about a fortnight, when by some means it got another <lb/>crack, and
                    lost its voice entirely. As make-shifts are very com<lb break="no"/>mon among
                    sailors, they found, on trial, that striking with the <lb/>hammer on the flook
                    of the anchor, answered the purpose as well, <lb/>and that was now our <hi
                        rend="i">bell</hi>. It is struck every half hour, but not <lb/>in imitation
                    of a clock. The day is divided into six parts. At <lb/>twelve at noon, it
                    strikes eight times, or eight bells, as the phrase is, <lb/>two and two strokes
                    distinct, „ . „ . „ . „ . at half after twelve, one <lb/>stroke; at one, two
                    strokes; at half-past one, three; and so on till <lb/>four o’clock; when, of
                    course, the eight strokes return. Then, be<lb break="no"/>ginning with one at
                    half past eight o’clock, they are again complete <lb/>at twelve. If the officer
                    says to the Captain, it is twelve or six <lb/>o’clock, the answer is, “make it
                    so.” When <rs type="person">the King</rs> was sailing in <lb/>a frigate at

                    After the bell has struck, <lb/>the sailors placed as watch on the shrouds, and

                    obtrusive.</p>
                <p><lb/>I have seen and known some persons, who possessed one or other <lb/>quality
                    of my father’s mind and heart, in an equal, and, perhaps, <lb/>superior degree;
                    but never any man, in whom so many excellent <lb/>and useful qualifications were
                    combined. In his conversation <lb/>with those, over whom the situation he held
                    in our Church had <lb/>placed him, he understood the rare art of gaining their
                    esteem and <lb/>respect, and even securing perfect submission to his superior
                        judg<lb break="no"/>ment, without ever, in the least degree, appealing to
                    his station or <lb/>authority! He was open and communicative, heard patiently
                    the <lb/>opinions of others, though differing from his own; received their
                    <lb/>instructions, when needed, and felt no hesitation in confessing, <lb/>that
                    he had been guided by the judgment of an inferior in situation <lb/>and ability.
                    He was the friend of all, and from the lowest to the <lb/>highest, all felt at
                    ease in his company. The lowest placed con<lb break="no"/>fidence in his
                    sincerity, as addressing a man, attentive to and <lb/>interested in his
                    concerns, and ever willing to advise and assist. <lb/>Again, I might quote many
                    instances, in which even the King’s <lb/>ministers treated him with marked
                    regard and attention, ho<lb break="no"/>nouring the uprightness of his heart,
                    and the nobleness of his spirit. <lb/>In conversing with inferiors, he had
                    nothing of that affectation of <lb/>condescension, which generally proves a
                    cobweb too thin to hide <lb/>the pride lurking beneath; and before men in power,
                    his courteous<lb break="no"/>ness partook of nothing like fear or cringing. As a
                    man of <lb/>strong feelings, he may have felt strong partialities; but he never
                    <lb/>suffered them to interfere with his judgment, nor did I ever hear <lb/>him
                    express dislike, much less resentment, against any individual, <lb/>not even
                    against a few, who treated him ill. Though strong in his <lb/>declarations of
                    abhorrence against vice, and especially against <lb/>untruth and insincerity, he
                    never directed his displeasure against <lb/>the sinner, but only against the
                    sin. As a peace-maker, he pos<lb break="no"/>sessed an extraordinary talent, and
                    it was ever his heart’s delight, <lb/>to bring about reconciliation and
                    good-will. God’s blessing at<pb n="392" break="no"/>

                    was <lb/>often changed into perfect friendship, through his mediation.</p>
                <p><lb/>In disinterested devotedness to the cause, to which he had <lb/>dedicated
                    his talents and his life, he set a noble example to all in <lb/>public stations
                    of every description. He never sought worldly <lb/>advantage, either for himself
                    or his family, in any thing he undertook. <lb/>But for the temporal as well as
                    spiritual welfare of others, he was <lb/>at all times ready to use his influence
                    and best exertions.</p>
                <p><lb/>In native eloquence, improved by study, we have never seen <lb/>his equal in

                    grant, that his pre-eminence over most preachers in his <lb/>day, was great. His
                    language flowed with such ease, that, even <lb/>when he raised his audience to
                    the highest enjoyment of the most <lb/>sublime and rapturous subjects, it was
                    perfectly intelligible to <lb/>all classes, without ever descending into what
                    might be considered <lb/>too colloquial or vulgar. His manner was always
                    luminous, power<lb break="no"/>ful, and full of fine imagery, explanatory of the
                    subject before him.</p>

                    <lb/>hope of glory he spoke with an energy and unction, which never <lb/>failed
                    to arrest attention, and touch the heart.</p>
                <p><lb/>Being possessed of a soul truly musical, while he encouraged the <lb/>use

                    resisted all innovation, tending to destroy the grandeur <lb/>and simplicity of
                    the true church-style, and his remarks on that <lb/>part of the service were
                    most judicious.</p>

                    flying over the <lb/>bulwarks, and on to the quarter deck. The sky looked wild,
                    and <lb/>we took in sail.</p>
                <p><lb/><date when-iso="1816-12-03">3d</date>. I did not feel well, but went on deck
                    to behold the sea, which <lb/>appeared rather furious. Mighty waves assailed us
                    on all sides, <lb/>and every precaution was taken. During the forenoon, we
                    sprung <lb/>our main-yard, and ran under close-reefed top-sails. The wind
                    <lb/>getting more aft, the ship began to roll very much. The hatch<lb break="no"

                    but we were proceeding fast in the right track. The clouds <lb/>in the west had
                    long looked very black, and now rose with lightning <lb/>and thunder, and a
                    heavy squall. All hands were turned up, as a se<lb break="no"/>vere gale was
                    expected. I retreated into my cabin. Both this and <lb/>the following day, the

                    <lb/>when we wanted it, the wind shifted to the north-west, and we ran <lb/>at
                    the rate of twelve knots for several hours. All hands were em<lb break="no"

                    <lb/>and it was a great amusement to me to watch the ship’s passage <lb/>over

                    and the sun <lb/>shone upon the boisterous ocean with great brightness. The

                    in several parts of <placeName role="mentioned">England</placeName>. We learnt

Also all other places further to be investigated and proposed by the landdrost of Uitenhagen where either occupied or in Caffraria (Xhosa-Land) and therefore not inhabitable with Khoikhoi-Settlements. This last farm is only described as an hour away from Somerset Farm, following the mountain range and fording the Small Fish River twice. Therefore the position is more of an estimation.",

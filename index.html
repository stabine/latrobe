            <h1>Christian Ignatius Latrobe's Voyage to South Africa 1815 - 1816</h1>
            <p>In 1815 <b><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2965351" target="_blank">Christian Ignatius Latrobe</a></b>, a reverend of the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravian_Church_of_the_British_Province" target="_blank">Moravian Church in England</a></b>, set off for South Africa. He was sent to settle disputes between the colonial authorities and the Moravian Brethren and to search for new locations for a third mission station.
                He recorded his experiences and explorations in a very interesting travel journal, which was published in 1818. In this <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/journalofvisitto00latr/mode/2up" target="_blank">journal</a></b>, he not only describes the state of the freshly english-occupied colony at the South African Cape, but also reports on the coexistence of Boers, indigenous people and the colonialists, provides insights into the way people traveled in the 19th century and adds vivid descriptions of the country, people and nature to his entries.
                Latrobe stays in South Africa for about a year during which he undertakes numerous small and large excursions. Three of his excursions are shown here, which are intended to provide a deeper understanding of his journey with the help of various forms of visualization.
            </p>
            <p>The following maps display 3 different excursions that each have different degrees of granularity.
                The <b><a href="#section1">first map</a></b> shows the way the <i>Albion</i>, a brigg on which Latrobe travled to the Cape. 
                The <b><a href="#section2">second map</a></b> zooms in on his stay in Gnadenthal (today known as Genadendal), the first settlement founded by the Moravian Church in South Africa in 1792. 
                The <b><a href="#section3">third map</a></b> shows Latrobe's actual exploration of the former cape colony from Genadendal all the way up to Somerset East (today called KwaNojoli).

            <h2>1 | Sea Voyage - Travle from Gravesend to Capetown</h2>
            <p>On 1 October 1815, Latrobe set off for Cape Town with the Albion, a brig under the command of Captain Bishop. He documents the voyage, which lasted a total of 84 days, i.e. almost 3 months, in the first chapter of the report. 
                For the most part, he gives details of the ship's position, describing which mainland or island is passed and in which direction it is situated. Of the 27 or so waypoints given in the text, 23 can be shown on a map. 
                In addition a probable route of the Albion was generated from the position information given in the text, alongside which the usual route of merchant ships in the 19th century is shown.</p>

            <h2>2 | A pleasant Stay - Time spend at Genadendal</h2>
            <p>On January 15, 1816, Latrobe arrived in Gnadenthal for the first time. He had previously visited numerous places in the vicinity of Cape Town. 
                On January 13th, he finally set out from Stellenbosch and traveled with an oxen wagon  over bumpy roads, through mountains and rivers to Gnadenthal. 
                It took two days for a journey that today can be covered in about 1.5 hours. After these numerous changes of location and arduous journeys, Latrobe stayed in Gnadenthal for an extended period. 
                On the one hand, to better  get to know the settlement, the surrounding area, and the missionaries stationed there, and on the other hand, to discuss matters of the Moravian Church and prepare for the planned exploratory trip into the interior of the cape colony.<br>
                This map shows the first day of his stay, January 15, 1816, and depicts only the places visited on that very first day, after arriving in Gnadenthal.</p>

            <h2>3 | Exploring South Africa - A Search for a new Mission</h2>
            <p>Together with the missionaries in Gnadenthal and with the support of the governor, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Charles_Somerset" target="_blank">Lord Charles Henry Somerset</a></b>, Latrobe planned a journey eastwards into the interior of the cape colony to find an unsettled but fertile piece of land for a third mission station of the Moravian Bretheren.
                He put together a travel party, which included the missionaries Johann Heinrich (called John Henry) and Alice Schmitt as well as Johann J端rgen Friedrich Stein (called John J端rgen) and the Surveyor to the Government, John Melville. 
                They were guided and accompanied by the Khoikhoi Marcus Moses, Christian Hector, Jeremias Waly, Lebrecht Aris, Johannes Paerl and his father Leonhard Paerl. 
                Equipped with a large oxen wagon for the travelling party, a small oxen wagon for the luggage and an additional 3 saddled horses for smaller explorations, this group set off eastwards on March 5th, 1816 through the districts of Zwellendam (Swellendam), George and Uitenhagen (Kariega) and back, briefly reaching the border of the former province of "Kaffraria". 
                A journey of more than 600 kilometres, which took the groupe just over 2 months.</p>
